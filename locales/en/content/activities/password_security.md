summary: >

  Weak and "shared" passwords are prevalent - even after hundreds of
  well-publicized global password breaches, "password" and "12345" remain the
  most popular passwords, and password re-use is common. Weak wifi passwords are
  specifically a challenge, as wifi signals often are accessible outside of an
  office's physical limits, but provide full access to the private network.
overview: >

  * Using the password survey, determine the organization's baseline for
  password security
materials_needed: >
  * A prepared Password Survey (given sensitivity and need for anonymity,
  consider printing and then shredding/burning).

  * The Level Up Activity, [Password Reverse
  Race](https://level-up.cc/curriculum/protecting-data/creating-and-managing-strong-passwords/activity-discussion/password-reverse-race/)
  provides a staff activity.

walk_through: >

  Adapt this survey to get a sense of how passwords are used in the
  organization.  Anonymous paper surveys, later destroyed, are a good way to
  gather this information. The earlier questions are more important in terms of
  getting a sense of password practices, so consider adapting or shortening the
  survey based on staff/leadership buy-in and risk considerations.

  your work?

recommendations: >



  Any important password should be long enough and complex enough to prevent
  both standard dictionary attacks and “brute-force attacks” in which clusters
  of powerful computers work in parallel to test every possible character
  combination. (We recommend 12 or more completely random characters or a
  passphrase that contains five or more relatively uncommon words.) The key
  should not contain common “phrases,” expecially from well known literature
  like Shakespeare or religious texts, but also should not include number
  sequences or phrases, especially if they are related to the organization, its
  employees or its work, and to use unique passwords for each account.


  Because this becomes logistically difficult, **password managers** such as
  KeePassX or other systems are recommended.


  Specifically for **wireless passwords**, choosing a strong WPA key is one of
  the most important steps toward defending an organization’s network perimeter
  from an adversary with the ability to spend some time in the vicinity of the
  offices. By extension, mitigating this vulnerability is critical to the
  protection of employees and partners (and confidential data) from the sort of
  persistent exposure that eventually brings down even the most well-secured
  information systems.


  Because shared keys inevitably end up being written on whiteboards, given to
  office visitors and emailed to partners, the WPA key should also be changed
  periodically. This does not have to happen frequently, but anything less than
  three or four times per year may be unsafe.


  As WPA3 becomes more widely adopted, upgrading your network to WPA3
  authentication will provide substantial security against wireless password
  attacks.
