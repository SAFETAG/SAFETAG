guiding_questions: >

  * What work and personal devices do staff use to accomplish their work, store work related files, or engage in work communications?

  * What organizational and external/personal services  do staff use to accomplish their work, store work related files, or engage in work communications?

  * How do staff communicate internal and external? What tools do they use?

  * What are the existing in/formal security practices that the participants use to address risks.

  * Who has physical access to what? Who has remote access to what?

  * When are devices not monitored by trusted staff?

  * How could adversaries gain access? (forced entry, theft, social engineering, seizure)

  * Are there mitigation procedures if devices are lost or taken by adversaries? (e.g.: encrypted drives, offsite backups?)

purpose: >

  Compromised devices have the ability to undermine nearly any other organizational attempt at securing information. Knowing if devices receive basic software and security updates/upgrades and what core protections exist against unauthorized access is vital to designing a strategy to make the host more secure. Because the SAFETAG framework is focused on the security of data, it's also crucial that the physicality of devices on which this data resides, including the hard-wired networks through which it's exchanged, be not overlooked.
