Based on the work from Berlin and revisions and feedback since, we have an updated and streamlined SAFETAG community governance document!

You can find it, alongside the Code of Conduct in the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/blob/master/en/document_matter/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the github repository, which contains the mission, community standards, and community governance structure.

This makes the code of conduct to better more specific, revised the community standards to reflect that the SAFETAG community is living within the orgsec.community world, and simplified the Advisory Board language to get things rolling sooner. As this becomes a self-sustained consortia, we can expand and codify additional items as necessary.
