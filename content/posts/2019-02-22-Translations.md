Please give a huge thanks to [Localization Lab](https://www.localizationlab.org/) and their network of expert volunteers.

Also note that we are very close to connecting the SAFETAG repository directly with the Transifex platform to streamline the translation process moving forward.  **SAFETAG welcomes new content in any language.** If you want to create new content in our current non-English languages or add content in a new language, please contact info@SAFETAG.org or [submit an issue](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/issues) so we can help get it set up.
