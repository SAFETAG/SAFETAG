A roadmap provides recommendations for action that are in relation to the organization's existing practices. This removes the barriers the host may feel about "starting from nothing." [^shostack_anchoring].

As part of SAFETAG's dedication to building agency and supporting organizational adoption of safer practices, a careful prioritization of vulnerabilities is invaluable in keeping audit results from appearing overwhelming. In addition, this component ranks the vulnerabilties identified using the risk-matrix developed with the host organization's staff. 

There are many trade-offs that have to be made when addressing threats. An organization needs to be able to weigh their possible paths forward against the time lost from program activities, the cost to implement the threat, and the other threats that they are not addressing. If the host can see how recommendations actively address threats ranked against their risk matrix to the critical processes they have identified they will be more likely to be engaged in putting those recommendations in place.

Roadmapping is used to give the host the tools to make these decisions and provide them with a recommended path forward that will allow them to make immediate gains towards protecting themselves.
