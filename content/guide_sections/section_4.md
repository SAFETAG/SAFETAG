# APPENDICES

## APPENDIX: Code of Conduct and SAFETAG Governance

### Mission Statement:

The mission of the SAFETAG community is to improve the security of civil society organizations around the world.

What we do: The community collaborates actively to share knowledge, build capacity, and create resources, while promoting transparency and accountability amongst its members, as well as with other communities of practice.

### Community Standards

The SAFETAG Community of Practice (SCoP) will a be a closed and private group, initially housed within the existing orgsec.community listserv.

* Community members are encouraged to be active - positively contributing / leading discussions on community channels, creating, curating, or peer-reviewing content or contributing to the issue queue. There will be an annual "introduction" thread on the listserv where all SCoP members are expected to respond with a short note on current (shareable) activities.
* Some SCoP members may have privacy concerns, and should join the community using a pseudonym they are comfortable with engaging online in both public and private spaces with.
* Joining the community: While housed within the orgsec.community, the SCoP will follow the joining process on that list.
* The SCoP is responsible for adhering to the SAFETAG Code of Conduct, below

#### SAFETAG Code of Conduct

Members of the SAFETAG community are expected to:

* Respect the auditees, their contexts (including the legal framework they operate within), and protect their privacy and security
* Protect the identifying information and audit findings of your auditees, unless you have full, informed consent of the auditee -- and even then, exercise extreme care.
* Never use your knowledge, skills and/or access to do harm against organizations or communities you are working with or your peer auditors through malice or neglect
* Minimize any conflict of interests through transparency in your contracting, reporting, and recommendations; e.g. if you were not hired initially to implement recommendations, suggest options other than yourself for implementation, and provide reporting that would enable that to be a success in every case.
* Perform your job responsibly and well. Ask and consult with fellow members of the community.
* Respect other members of the community as peers and promote a safe, inclusive, and harassment-free environment

#### Community Manager

There will be, given that funds are available, a paid **community manager** who has at least a quarter of their time to support the SAFETAG community and contribute to and support the broader community around NGO organizational security.  This community manager should rotate among organizations implementing substantial organizational security work. There may be gaps and/or overlaps due to project and staff funding requirements; it is important for implementing organizations to coordinate funding this position in order to minimize this.

The CM's role is to cultivate, support, and grow the community.  This includes, but is not limited to:

* Proposing, planning, and facilitating discussions to support a vibrant and active community
* To a reasonable degree and avoiding conflicts of interest, supporting and coordinating fundraising work across the community
* Providing transparency to the work being done across the implementing community, including the sharing of any requests for audits.
* Shepherding and supporting the creation of new content (managing peer review, managing pull requests, providing guidance and direct support on merging content into the SAFETAG architecture)
* Supporting the ongoing development of the SAFETAG mission, vision, code of conduct, licensing, and related "meta" content.
* Managing the technical infrastructure (website, content repository)
* Providing at least quarterly reports to the community summarizing activity such as new content, supporting tools or interfaces, new opportunities, and new members
* Scheduling and joining Advisory Board meetings to participate as well as take notes as relevant.
* Documenting the activities, duties, and challenges for future community managers.

### The Advisory Board

#### Structure

* An **Advisory Board** of no more than 10 and no fewer than 3 persons shall be made of individuals and institutional representatives, nominated by the board.
* Board members are to serve 18 month terms; 2 consecutive term limit. Institutions are not term limited, but are encouraged to change their representation to the Board when representatives have served two consecutive terms, and are expected to step down if they are unable to continue contributions defined below.
* There can be up to four institutional members of the board, representing organisations that have a vested interest in SAFETAG, due to using it extensively in their own programs. Institutions should designate a representative with a relevant program role and experience with organizational security. Institutional members of the Board are expected to significantly contribute, through funding the community manager, significant content contributions, infrastructure or activities.
* Board members, including institutions, will be appointed and dismissed by simple majority of votes cast by board members with a voting window of two weeks.
* Board meetings over calls or in person ought to be minuted, the board chair is responsible for identifying a note taker.
* Board members who do not participate in voting processes and fail to join 2 consecutive board calls without excusing themselves in advance to the board are automatically removed from the board and trigger the voting in of a new member

#### Responsibilities

* The Board is responsible for the stewardship of the SAFETAG framework and supporting and advising the CM.
* The Board is responsible for ensuring that the responsibilities of a CM are performed, whether completely by the CM, by a combination of CM and Board members, or by Board members during gaps in the CM role, as well as measuring the performance of the CM
* The Board will be responsible for proposing changes to these governance rules, through simple majority voting
* All members of the Board will provide an ombudsman service to sensitively manage ethics concerns regarding the community manager, fellow board members, and usage of the SAFETAG framework and trademark more broadly

## APPENDIX: How to contribute to SAFETAG

### Contributing to SAFETAG

SAFETAG welcomes contributions!

SAFETAG is a community-managed product with an advisory board and community management roles laid out in our [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]. The Code of Conduct further outlines expectations of not only those using the content herein but also those contributing to it. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

When submitting new content, please write in clear, concise, and gender neutral language. This document will be updated with guidance on content translation once we have settled on a process for that. If you would like to submit content in a language other than English, Spanish, Arabic, or Russian - please open an issue to set that language up for submission.

### Getting Starting

Before you start work, it is critically important to review the current content and existing [issues][issues] and **create a new issue for your proposed work** to solicit feedback -- this will save you a lot of time as the SAFETAG community can help refine your idea and advise on where best to include it in the framework (is it a new method? An activity or variant? Is there existing content in SAFETAG to update or improve?), as well as suggest additional resources worth considering, operational security and safety considerations.

You can also join the [public slack](https://join.slack.com/t/humansafetag/) to discuss changes and ask questions to the community.

### Content Creation Guidelines

*This section helps walk you though how SAFETAG is constructed, and what pieces of content are important to provide in a submission. Submissions which do not follow these guidelines will take significantly longer to be incorporated.*

SAFETAG has currently three main compiled products - an **overview guide**, the **full guide**, and a **curricula** to help train new auditors.  This guide is primarily focused on the non-curricular SAFTAG content. The Curricula is an ADIDS-based approach to training on SAFETAG content (read more about the curricula content at [https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/wiki/Curricula-Document-Template](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/wiki/Curricula-Document-Template)

The SAFETAG overview is the easiest place to start. The full guide is a comprehensive collection of not only the method-based objectives of the audit, but a variety of specific activities an auditor might choose to use and combine to achieve those. Both of these are built from the collection of Methods and Activities that make up SAFETAG.

Generally speaking, **Methods** are high-level, goal-focused aspects of the assessment.  There are inevitable "fuzzy" borders between some methods. Creation of new methods should be minimized to not overly complicate the scope of SAFETAG.

**Activities** are the meat of an audit, and answer "how" and "where" type questions.  To accomplish the goals of a method, one might conduct multiple activities to explore and verify organization practices from different angles - research, policy review, conversations / discussions, and technical verification, exploration, and scanning.

Within both Methods and Activities are smaller chunks of content which are used across the full range of SAFETAG "products." The tables below map out what content chunks exist across which products, and what they are. The [Templates](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates) folder has sub-folders which provide the default files and indices for methods and activities.

#### Language Guide

Although SAFETAG contributors and users come from around the world, adherence to a single style guide and linguistic conventions will improve the readability and cohesion of SAFETAG as a resource.

* The English version of SAFETAG defaults to being written in American English (_Organization_, not _Organisation_). Please note that this will not block contributions.
* Use the Oxford Comma (_Interview management, staff, and volunteers_)

### Creating a new SAFETAG Method

* Follow the Getting Started instructions above.
* Decide on a name for the method, and create the a corresponding folder (lowercased, with _ replacing spaces). If your new method is "Creating SAFETAG Content", the folder would be *en/methods/creating_safetag_content*.
* Copy the Method [template](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates) files from [https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders/method](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders/method) into the method folder. The content of these files is described below.
* Create index files for your method: In addition to the content files below, each Method must also have two index files, a method_name.guide.md and a method_name.overview.md . The contents of these index files are generally the same for every method, and templates exist at [https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders) .

**New methods must be linked into the master index file, and must have activities linked to them.** To link the new method into the master index file (and therefore have the method "included" in the "master" SAFETAG build, these index files must be linked into the relevant master index file in the language folder (*en/index.guide.md* and *en/index.overview.md*).  See below for how Activities are linked in to the methods.

#### Method Content notes:

* Try to focus on creating Activities rather than Methods.
* All Methods must have all of the content listed below unless marked as "optional".
* All Methods must have at least one activity associated with them.
* Ideally, also create curricula content for each Method, or at least notes for someone training on the topic.

#### Method Section and Stylistic notes:

* Methods should operate at header 2 and 3.  The Method title is h2, and the major subheadings (below) are h3.  No additional header levels should be used.
* The Flow of Information graphics live in *en/images/info_flows* and follow the *method_name.svg* naming convention.

| Section|ADIDS|Guide|Overview|Definition|
|--|-|-|-|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Quote|-|-|-|OPTIONAL: No longer included in the compiled guides, but an introductory / framing quote for the section|
| Summary|-|+|+|A short - two to three sentence - basic overview of the methodology -- What is the auditor doing , what are the high-level outputs and processes?|
| Purpose|+|+|+|The justification for why this methodology is used -- Why is this collection of activities being pursued? what is the end goal?|
| Information Flow|-|+|+|The "Flow of Information" shows the types of information that an audit activity builds upon (input), and the types of information that an audit activity may reveal (outcomes). As this information is acquired, earlier audit will have to be re-visited based upon this information --  What are the inputs which feed in to this, and what outputs are possible/expected? Modify the Information Flow diagram in images/info_flows|
| Guiding Questions|+|+|+|Each audit activity is guided by a small set of core questions. Key questions are included to help an auditor identify when they have acquired enough information and customize their approach while still collecting the correct types of information to support the organization -- What are specific guiding or research questions to be answered by conducting activities in pursuit of the larger goal?|
| Outputs|-|+|-|The data or impact is expected from this method -- What are specific outputs to aim for? These should further clarify the information flow diagram above.|
| Operational Security|-|+|+|OPTIONAL: Operational Security considerations -- Does pursuing this objective have any broad operational security challenges to be aware of that is not otherwise captured in the per-activity detail?|
| Preparation|-|+|-|OPTIONAL: Any preparation, skills, or materials needed for the method as a whole.  Individual exercises will specify this more exactly -- What must an auditor do to prepare for this work that is not otherwise captured in the per-activity detail?|
| Approaches|-|+|+|No longer used - this was a high-level bullet list of potential activities; now specific activities should be refernced or created instead, and other relevant method-level content should be moved to other sections as relevant. |
| Resources|-|+|-| Resources should include not only the research used in the creation of the method, but also recommended reading, references, and additional options for conducting this work -- What references did you use in creating this method?  Are there references which provide activity style walkthroughs or additional backgrounds? Are there existing collections of references (in the references folder) that an auditor should review when looking at this methodology.|
| Activities|-|+|-|Many of these audit activities can be completed in multiple ways depending upon auditor skill and the organizational technical setup and capacity. Methods should include existing or new activities to carry out parts, or the whole, of the information collection for the method. Each method should have different types of approaches - some might be technical, some research, some interactive.  See "Creating a New SAFETAG Activity" -- What existing activities are useful to achieve the goal and specific output(s) listed? Do they represent? If creating a new method, often new activities will be needed to ensure the suggested approaches are "filled in".  Please note that Activities are separate documents linked in to the Methods|

### Creating a new SAFETAG Activity

* Follow the Getting Started instructions above.
* Decide on a name for the activity, and create the a corresponding folder (lowercased, with _ replacing spaces). Activity contents live in the exercises folder under the language folder, so *en/exercise/exercise_name/...*).  If your new activity is "Using atom to edit SAFETAG markdown files", the folder would be something like *en/exercises/using_atom/* .
* Copy the Activity [template][templates] files from [https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders/activity](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders/activity) into the method folder. The content of these files is described below.
* Activity contents also have an index file (within the same folder, not above it as with methods).  The index file needs to be updated with the title of the activity but is otherwise the same across most activities.

**New activities must be linked to a method.** To link an activity to a method, add it directly to index.guide.md under the method. If adding an activity to multiple methods, select a primary method where it is the most relevant to that method's outputs, and for additional methods, link it in following this format:

```
 <div class="boxtext">
 #### Activity Title
 Covered in full in **Primary Method**
 </div>
```

#### Activity Content notes:

* Try to focus on creating Activities rather than Methods.
* All Activities must have all of the content listed below unless marked as "optional".
* All Activities must be linked to at least one Method.
* Ideally, also create curricula content for each Activity, or at least notes for someone training on the topic.

**Note:** For activities where multiple different approaches could fulfill the exact same goals consider building **activity variants**, see below

#### Activity Content and Stylistic notes:

* Activities should operate at header 4 and below, the Activity title is h4, the major subheadings (below) are h5, so any headings within the content (most often used in the instructions/walkthrough file for variants) must only be at h6.

| Section|ADIDS|Guide|Overview|Definition|
|--|-|-|-|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Summary|-|+|-|A concise description of the exercise. This describes the vulnerability of class of vulnerabilities (e.g. "PHP is out of date") and its overall impact -- What does this specific activity accomplish?|
| Overview|-|+|-|A short, bulleted list that clarifies the general steps, especially for cases where the walkthrough is very complex or involves multiple or parallel processes.  Also included when only referencing an exercise from a method, instead of including the full exercise.|
| Materials Needed|-|+|-|Optional; does this require specific software, hardware, or preparation?|
| Considerations|-|+|-|Optional; Notes on safely carrying out the activity and protecting the data collected, as well as other challenges (psycho-social, legal, ethical) to be aware of -- Are there operational security concerns, or important baseline skills to master before undertaking this activity?|
| Walkthrough|-|+|-|A multi-use guide with concise instructions for a skilled technologist to replicate or prove the vulnerability.  This is used in the SAFETAG curricula, by auditors needing to recall that random flag for that one command without going online, and for the organization's technical staff to verify that this vulnerability has been addressed. This should provide concise guidance at a peer level for the general steps an auditor should take, but should point to, not re-create existing documentation. For technical aspects, ideal walkthroughs should enable IT staff/contractors to follow along and verify fixes. For research activities, research methods and preferred resources should be provided, and for facilitative exercises, a clear explanation of the process and any tips or challenges should be explained.|
| Variants|-|+|-|Parallel approaches which can be used for the same affect but might work better in different contexts. See below for when and how to use these |
| Recommendations|-|+|-|Optional; Sample text of common recommendations for how to address vulnerabilities identified through this activity; e.g. "Work with the webmaster to update PHP and/or migrate to a hosting system which manages this automatically...") -- for activities which have common findings, provide stock language to assist in report creation|

In some cases, one activity will have many parallel ways to achieve the goal this is often the case with technical activities where there is a collection of similar tools all focused on the same overall outcome.  In cases like these, it is best to create *Activity Variants* instead of new activities.  This lets different auditors select and use tools and approaches they are most comfortable with, while still operating within the larger SAFETAG framework. **Add these as part of the Walkthrough section with a h6 title.**

### Other SAFETAG Content

These sections operate at header level 1, and for the most part should be included in any custom creation of SAFETAG products.

#### Front and Back Matter

Generally speaking, these sections won't be updated very often.

## APPENDIX: Remote Facilitation

#### Remote Facilitation

##### Summary
This component suggests approaches to use if in-person facilitation is not possible, and to include participation from remote staff or offices when an organization has multiple locations. This supplements the Data Assessment, Process Mapping, and Threat Assessment exercises, enabling them to be conducted remotely.

This may not provide as deep results as in-person facilitation, but should provide adequate levels of expansion and verification of information needed, and even provide the secondary benefits in most cases of helping the organization build a shared understanding of its processes, risks, and riosk tolerances.

##### Overview
Conducting digital security audit remotely requires great commitment from both auditor and the organization. It requires careful planning, scheduling, documentation and coordination from both parties.

As situations may arise during the course of the project, adherence to the activities indicated on the project plan is required. Constant communication and participation are the keys for a successful remote audit.

After preparing the list in "materials_needed", you may first start selecting or combining different approaches in conducting remote audit.

There are four different approaches you can use, depending on what resources are available, the size and structure of the organization, and which activities you are trying to facilitate remotely. Is there someone that can help as an on-site facilitator? Are video conferences realistic (given bandwidth and cost)? How does the approach you use interact with existing organizational team structures?

* **Approach 1: On-site facilitator**: This provides the most valuable interaction, but requires a person who can take on the facilitation role on-site, while the auditor is over video chat.  The facilitator does not have to be a technical person, but should be able to manage the session, making sure that it is as inclusive and as productive as possible. Accommodates more participants per session than Approach 3 per session.

* **Approach 2, hybrid online/synchronous**: This can be used with a large group of participants where it is possible to meet over multiple sessions with enough time to collect and analyse responses in between.

* **Approach 3, multiple small sessions**: Consists of multiple small full sessions over video chats, of no more than four participants at a time to assure inclusiveness. Suitable for medium to large groups where it is possible to conduct multiple small video chats.

* **Approach 4, hybrid offline/surveys**: This leverages surveys and shorters calls or emails. It will provide less information overall, but can be used when it is not possible to meet in person, over video chat, or through a local facilitator.

Planning your audit:

  - Number of staff (office based, remote)
  - Schedule (Upcoming calendar events)
  - Availability (Can be 30min to 1hour a day/individual or can be 1 hour for a group of 4-5)
  - Communication method (Video, email, chat)

Depending on which area you are auditing, you may decide on using mixed approaches during the course of the audit.










##### Materials Needed
In preparation with the remote facilitation activity, the following materials and documentation should be considered.

  * Communication Guidelines
  * Approved communication applications and channels (including fallback communication channels)
  * Questionnaire, survey forms, templates (categorized)
  * Auditing tools: Remote Desktop applications, auditing software (Lynis, Belarc Advisor)
  * Project planning tools (Online Gantt Chart, Task Management etc)




##### Considerations
Remote facilitation, if not done securely, can expose sensitive information from both the auditor and the organization. There are different ways to communicate and exchange information remotely. This can be by voice calls, emails, video conference, survey forms cloud storages and chat messages. Choose your tools based on ease of adoption for the organization, proven security, and open source, ideally audited code when possible.  

##### Walkthrough
Selecting the most suitable approach requires understanding of the capacity and personel structure of the organization, including their ability to support communication technologies, and the availability of someone that can assist in facilitation.

After selecting the most suitable approach, auditor should make sure to prepare for remote facilitation:

* Work with the organization point of contact to select the most suitable approach.
* Schedule calls/meetings and/or discuss timelines for survey preparation, sending, and deadlines for input.
* Prepare any material to be sent and distributed beforehand.
* Coordinate (including perhaps training) with on-site facilitator if ny.
* Prepare at least one fallback communication channel.
* Test communication channels.

###### Approach 1, on-site facilitator, with video chat auditor

Suitable when there is a person that can take a facilitation role on-site. Facilitator does not have to be a technical person, but should be able to manage the session, making sure that it is as inclusive and as productive as possible. Accommodates more participants than Approach 3 per session. If the auditor is able to join remotely, this provides an ideal substitute.

  * On-site facililtator assists in conducting the over all exercise, ensuring inclusion of all participants. Level of facilitator envolvement needs to be decided between the facilitator and auditor before the session, and if needed training may be provided to the facilitator
  * Auditor follows along via video chat through the full exercise and discussion, and is able to contribute or ask follow-up questions as needed.
  * Facilitator leads the session and managing note-taking, as well as secure sharing of notes post-session.
  * Follow up sessions may be arranged with selected groups of staff.

###### Approach 2, hybrid online/synchronous
Can be used with large group of participants, where it is possible to meet over multiple sessions with enough time to collect and analyse responses in between.

  * An introductory video chat is recommended as a starting point, this allows the auditor to introduce themselves, the exercise, and agree on communication rules. This will help in building rapport, and address any concerns participants may have, as well as allow for further testing of communication channel.
  * The auditor ask participants to fill in a template or survey to collect information needed (See Approach 4 for survey details), this stems directly from the activity, whether it is data assessment, process mapping, threat analysis, or any activity requiring facilitation.
  * Participants send their input to auditor, either through answering into and online questionnaire, or through any other media agreed on.
  * Auditor collect the information and arrange them for analysis and discussion.
  * Another video chat is conducted to discuss responses and expand and validate on information collected through the survey.
  * Follow up sessions may be arranged with selected groups of staff as needed.

###### Approach 3, multiple small sessions
Suitable for medium to large groups where it is possible to conduct multiple small video chats. It is recommended for sessions to be arranged to include people from the same organizational level, but different functions/teams/arms/departments of the organization.  This approach scales to larger organizations and helps ensure voices at different levels of the organization are heard.

  * Auditor works with participants via video chat through the full exercise and discussion.
  * Follow up sessions may be arranged with selected groups of staff as needed.


###### Approach 4, hybrid offline/asynchronous
  * Introductory email/session through local facilitator (may need to provide remote training on the activities).
  * Collect responses and input through a survey.
  * Discuss responses and finding via email or voice chat to expand and validate.
