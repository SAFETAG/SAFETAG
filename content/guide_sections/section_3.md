# Reporting

## Recommendation Development

### Summary

In this component the auditor identifies the organization's strengths and weakness (expertise, finance, willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) to adopting new digital and physical security practices and documents the possible actions the organization could take on to address the vulnerabilities found during the audit, the difficulty of taking on those actions, and the resources that the host may be able to leverage to address them. Resources can include, but are not limited to, local technical support and incident response groups/trade organizations, places to obtain discount software, trainers, and guides/resrouces they can use to support their up-skilling.

### Purpose

The host needs to be able to take action after an audit. The recommendations that an auditor provides to address vulnerabilities must cover a range that allows an organization to address them in both the short-term and more comprehensively in the long-term. Knowing an organization's strengths and weaknesses will allow the auditor to provide more tailored recommendations that an organization will be more likely to attempt and achieve. In doing this the SAFETAG auditor has an opportunity to act as a trusted conduit between civil society organizations in need and organizations providing digital security training, technological support, legal assistance, and incident response.

### Guiding Questions

* What are the organizational areas of strength  (expertise, finance,
  willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) that the organization can leverage
  when engaging in technological adoption/change?
* What are the organizational areas of weakness  (expertise, finance,
  willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) that need to be taken into
  consideration when engaging in technological adoption/change?
* What are the organizational barriers to adoption?
* Are the recommendations you are providing directly related to the security
  audit? If not, do they support the organization in accomplishing their
  security tasks, or distract from them? 

### Approaches

* **Identify and Explain Un-Addressed Concerns :** Write explanations for why any adversaries or threats that the auditor identifies as "un-addressable" with the organizations current capacity.
* **Identify Recommendations:** Identify possible actions to address each vulnerability.
* **Identify Useful Resources:** Identify resources that the organization can leverage to accomplish the identified recommendations.

### Outputs

* Short-term recommendations to address each vulnerability.
* Long-term recommendations to address each vulnerability.
* Summaries of why recommendations were not given for any vulnerabilities or adversaries.
* Lists of organizations that can assist the host accomplish their task.
* Lists of educational resources the organization can use for training.
* Contact information for recommended trainers who can help with digital security training.

### Operation Security

* Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.
* Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization's country, or is known to surveil.
* Do not share any organization information or data when reaching out to possible resources.

## Resource Identification

### Summary

In this component the auditor documents resources that the host may be able to leverage to address the technical, regulatory, organizational, or behavioral vulnerabilities identified during the audit.

This can include, but is not limited to, local technical support and incident response groups/trade organizations, places to obtain discount software, trainers, and guides/resources they can use to support their up-skilling.

### Overview

* Identify trusted resources that the organization can leverage to accomplish the identified recommendations.

### Materials Needed

### Considerations

* Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization’s country, or is known to surveil.
* Do not share any organization information or data when reaching out to possible resources.

### Walkthrough

* Lists of organizations that can assist the host accomplish their task.
* Lists of educational resources the organization can use for training.
* Contact information for recommended trainers who can help with digital security training.

## Roadmap Development

"*Finding threats against arbitrary things is fun, but when you're building some-thing with many moving parts, you need to know where to start, and how to approach it.*" - *Threat Modeling: Designing for Security* by Adam Shostack [90](https://safetag.org/guide/#fn90)

### Summary

This component consists of an auditor sorting their recommendations in relation to the organizations threats and capacity. The auditor prioritizes vulnerabilities, weighs the implementation costs of recommendations and then creates an actionable roadmap for the organization to make their own informed choices about possible next steps as they move forward.

### Purpose

As part of SAFETAG's dedication to building agency and supporting organizational adoption of safer practices, a careful prioritization of vulnerabilities is invaluable in keeping audit results from appearing overwhelming. An organization needs to be able to weigh their possible paths forward against the time lost from program activities, the cost to implement the threat, and the other threats that they are not addressing. Roadmapping is used to give the host the tools to make these decisions and provide them with a recommended path forward that will allow them to make immediate gains towards protecting themselves. The existing in/formal security practices captured during this process will be used to remove organizational and psyco-social barriers to starting new practices.

### Baseline Skills

### Preparation

### Materials Needed

### Approach

### Outputs

* A risk matrix with all vulnerabilities ranked on it.
* An "implementation matrix" showing each recommendation in relation to its difficulty to implement and its urgency.
* An overview of the risks the organization is accepting until they address each vulnerability.
* A short overview of the how the likelihood was determined for vulnerabilities.
* A listing of the process, impact, and likelihood for each vulnerability.
* A roadmap for a "recommended path" to address the threats the host faces.
* A short description of why a recommendation (and corresponding threat) was ranked with the urgency it was assigned.

### Operational Security

* Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.
* The roadmap may be shared with local IT support, digital security trainers, possible funders, or other consultants in part, or in full. Consider the content in light of this.

  * Individual vulnerabilities should be able to be read, and acted upon, independently from the rest of the report so that the organization can easily provide only the required information for follow up work.
  * The overall posture and risk/ranking profile components should be able to be read independent from the risk model and be free of any specific vulnerabilities to allow the organization to easily provide trusted invested parties with an overview of the results/need without exposing any specific vulnerabilities.
* Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization’s country, or is known to surveil.

* *Book:* "The Order of Mitigation - p. 131" (Threat Modeling - Adam Shostack)[91](https://safetag.org/guide/#fn91)

## Report Creation

"*A good analysis might turn the threats into stories so they stay close to mind as software is being written or reviewed. A good story contains conflict, and conflict has sides. In this case, you are on one side, and an attacker is the other side.*" - *Threat Modeling: Designing for Security* [92](https://safetag.org/guide/#fn92)

### Summary

This component consists of an auditor compiling their audit notes and recommendations into a comprehensive set of documents the shows the current state of security, the process by which the auditor came to that assessment, and recommendations that will guide the hosts progression to meet their security goals.

### Purpose

Once an auditor has left, the report is the auditor's chance to continue a conversation (albeit a static one) -- even if the organization never talks to the auditor again. If written with care it can be a tool to encourage agency and guide adoption. The report has many audiences who will need to use it in different ways. For the auditor and the organization, it acts as documentation of what an auditor accomplished. For the organization, it will be guide for connecting vulnerabilities to actual risks, a rallying cry for change, and proof of need for funders. For those the organization brings in to support their digital security, it provides a roadmap towards that implementation and a task-list for future technologists and trainers paid to get the host there - as well as a checklist for validating that threats have been addressed.

### Baseline Skills

### Preparation

### Materials Needed

### Approach

* Create charts and visuals for roadmap, risk-matrix, implementation matrix, and critical processes.
* Compile approaches, impact, risk, recommendations and resources for each vulnerability.
* Prepare narrative components.
* Write explanations for why any adversaries or threats that the auditor identifies as "un-addressable" with the organizations current capacity.
* Collect agreements & scope.
* Document tools used for testing where needed.
* Update glossary where needed.
* Compile full report contents.
* Send the report to client. [93](https://safetag.org/guide/#fn93)

### Outputs

* A completed report delivered securely to the organizational point of contact.
* Documented process examples to submit back to SAFETAG.

### Operational Security

* Treat the report with the utmost security. It should only be shared as a complete work between the auditor(s) and the identified leadership and points of contact of the organization.
