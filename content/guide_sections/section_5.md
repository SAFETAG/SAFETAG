# Footnotes


<!-- Notes -->

Usually when working with an external funder an engagement report, free of sensitive data about the host organization, will be created for submission the funder. The contents of this report should be clearly outlined and agreed to during the assessment plan stage.

[^secure_reporting]:"When a pilot lands an airliner, their job isn’t over. They still have to navigate the myriad of taxiways and park at the gate safely. The same is true of you and your pen test reports, just because its finished doesn't mean you can switch off entirely. You still have to get the report out to the client, and you have to do so securely. Electronic distribution using public key cryptography is probably the best option, but not always possible. If symmetric encryption is to be used, a strong key should be used and must be transmitted out of band. Under no circumstances should a report be transmitted unencrypted. It all sounds like common sense, but all too often people fall down at the final hurdle." - [The Art of Writing Penetration Test Reports](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/writing-penetration-testing-reports/)

[^stares_and_snide_comments]:"I once performed a social engineering test, the results of which were less than ideal for the client. The enraged CEO shared the report with the whole organization, as a way of raising awareness of social engineering attacks. This was made more interesting, when I visited that same company a few weeks later to deliver some security awareness training. During my introduction, I explained that my company did security testing and was responsible for the social engineering test a few weeks back. This was greeted with angry stares and snide comments about how I’d gotten them all into trouble. My response was, as always, “better to give me your passwords than a genuine bad guy”." - [The Art of Writing Penetration Test Reports](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/writing-penetration-testing-reports/)

[^NIST_pen_test_danger]:"Penetration testing also poses a high risk to the organization’s networks and systems because it uses real exploits and attacks against production systems and data. Because of its high cost and potential impact, penetration testing of an organization’s network and systems on an annual basis may be sufficient. Also, penetration testing can be designed to stop when the tester reaches a point when an additional action will cause damage." - [NIST SP 800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-115/SP800-115.pdf#page=40)
