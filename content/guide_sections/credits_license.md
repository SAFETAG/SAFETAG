## License

SAFETAG is a trademark of Internews.

SAFETAG resources are available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0) License

The audit framework and checklist may be used and shared for educational, non-commercial, not-for-profit purposes, with attribution to Internews. Users are free to modify and distribute content under conditions listed in the license.

The audit framework and checklist is intended as reference and the authors take no responsibility for the safety and security of persons using them in a personal or professional capacity.

If you have further questions related to licensing PLEASE [create an issue](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/issues) about it on GitHub. We are excited to discuss how we can best support those who wish to use SAFETAG and best attribute those whose content we adapted or redistributed through SAFETAG.

### Usage of "SAFETAG"

SAFETAG is itself a framework and template for organizational audits.  As such, audits performed which use or adapt SAFETAG materials may be referred to as "adapting the SAFETAG methodology" or "based on the SAFETAG framework", and similar phrasings, but may NOT be called "SAFETAG audits".

This is not intended to imply that an audit using any or all of the SAFETAG materials need to refer to SAFETAG at all.

This usage policy does not affect the distribution of SAFETAG materials, covered in the license statement above.
