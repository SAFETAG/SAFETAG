summary: >

  This activity assists in identifying potential physical security concerns at
  an organization, particularly when an auditor cannot travel to the office
  location or cannot visit every office location. The scavenger hunt approach is
  focused on involving the organization staff members into mapping out potential
  threats based on the abstraction and the gamification of the physical security
  mapping process. See the "Risk Hunting" exercise in
  [SaferJourno](https://www.internews.org/sites/default/files/resources/SaferJournoGuide_2014-03-21.pdf),
  page 19, for additional ideas and guidance on conducting this activity.
overview: >

  A local facilitator is required to lead this "scavenger hunt" where staff
  members seek out potential physical security challenges themselves. This
  activity should only be conducted within an environment with a high level of
  trust and consent. The auditor should get the agreement from the host NGO to
  involve all staff members into the exercise to avoid causing trust issues. By
  involving the staff members in identifying physical security risks, you are
  also taking a step forward to increase  awareness on these issues. 


  With facilitation, staff members will explore their own office looking for
  potential physical security risks and share results. To reduce the risk of
  individual staff embarrassment, they will first review their own working space
  and secure it before looking around other parts of the office.  The
  facilitator, in consultation with the auditor and the organizational point of
  contact may declare some areas "off limits"
materials_needed: |

  * (Optional) Mobile phone cameras (see operational security considerations)
  * Notepad + Pen for each staff member
  * Printout of example security risks
  * Encrypted file sharing platform (Signal)
considerations: >
  * Reset credentials found during the process.

  * Any photos taken (of the map drawing or specific office areas/rooms) should
  be securely deleted or taken using a secure camera app such as
  [ObscuraCam](https://guardianproject.info/apps/obscuracam/). Photos of keys in
  particular can be used to duplicate a key. The instructions below simply use
  notepads to track concerns, reducing this risk but possibly being less
  impactful.

  * Any physical notes taken on physical security should be destroyed. Digital
  notes should be kept in line with overall SAFETAG standards.

  * The location of certain high-value assets is highly sensitive, and may be
  controlled/secret information. Handle with care when discussing with the
  organization, and if conducting this remotely/in advance, ensure the point of
  contact can handle and destroy the data responsibly.

  * It should be noted that SAFETAG is focused only on the digital impacts of
  physical security.  This guide does not provide a full physical security
  assessment.
walk_through: >
  The auditor should first meet with the facilitator (possibly over secure
  videochat) to brief them on the activity and map out potential challenges
  (particularly around trust, organizational hierarchies, and any potential
  repercussions). 


  The auditor then prepares a checklist of physical vulnerabilities with the
  facilitator, based on the current understanding of the organization's assets
  and the context they are operating within. The auditor, facilitator, and
  organization point of contact should decide if any areas are "off limits." 
  Note that this is only a list of a suggestions. As with the "Risk Hunting"
  exercise in
  [SaferJourno](https://www.internews.org/sites/default/files/resources/SaferJournoGuide_2014-03-21.pdf),
  and it should be modified to fit the requirements, assets, and threats the
  organization faces:


  * Open windows.

  * Door with key hanging from the lock and/or unlocked doors to secure areas

  * Unlocked access to networking equipment - routers, wifi, modem / cablemodem
  / servers

  * Unsecured Laptop(s) (e.g. no locked cabinet for overnight storage, no cable
  lock) 

  * Computer left unattended with active Outlook, Gmail, Skype or other
  communication application open and visible.

  * Wires or cables for devices that have been strewn on the floor where someone
  would need to step over them.

  * Portable backup drives, USBs, and/or other external hard drives on desktops
  or plugged in to computers

  * Passwords written on a “sticky note” or other paper taped to a monitor or
  onto the surface of a desk.

  * Smartphones, cameras or other valuable devices left unattended


  At the organization, the facilitator explains the activity to the organization
  members. To balance the need for consent with the benefits of identifying
  actual daily practices which may need improvement, the staff should already be
  aware that examining physical devices is part of the audit scope, but not the
  specific activity. Staff will be able to first identify and address their
  personal concerns before others.


  * Each staff member will get a paper and a pen to note the physical
  vulnerabilities that they notice (cameras/cellphone cameras can also be used,
  note the operational security considerations listed).

  * For each vulnerability noted, the staff member will get a point.  The
  facilitator should encourage staff to also look for other, not listed,
  vulnerabilities. For vulnerabilities that staff members suggest which were not
  listed; if they can explain how that vulnerability would realistically be
  exploited, the facilitator can award a point. 

  * If possible, a prize should be provided to the "winner" with the most
  points.

  * Staff must first check their own desks for 5-10 minutes total:
      * Review the physical security of their work space. 
      * Take pictures or notes on their findings
      * Fix each vulnerability they found
      * Report back to the facilitator
  * In the entire office space, staff members will spend 15 minutes to:
      * Review the physical security of other desks, meeting rooms, shared spaces etc...
      * Take pictures or notes on their findings without touching anything
      * Report back to the facilitator
  * Debrief:
      *  After the "hunt" time is up, the facilitator should gather the staff back together. 
      * The facilitator will gather the notes and review quickly for any high-risk or embarrassing findings.  If those exist, the facilitator should privately tell the finder to not bring that up in discussion
      * The facilitator can lead a discussion on interesting findings, but focus on moving towards changes in practice and policy for the organization to consider.
      * If possible, quickly calculate scores and announce the winner 
  * Reporting:
      * The facilitator should combine the notes and communicate them securely to the Auditor, and securely destroy the notes.
