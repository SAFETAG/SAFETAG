summary: |
  This activity helps auditors to test the strength of defenses the
  organizations' network has in place to protect their local area network.
  This component consists of gaining access to the local area network through a
  wireless access point and unsecured physical channels (such as an ethernet
  jack).
overview: |
  * Determine the security of the wireless access point (WAP).
  * Gain access to the organizations Wireless network access.
  * Test unused ethernet ports for live network connectivity.
  * Find out how guest access is managed
  **Expected Outputs**
  * Un-authorized access to the Wireless access point (WAP)
  * List of unused ethernet jacks with network connectivity.

  *Note*:
  Cracking wireless passwords often take a huge amount of time performing, and
  the same results for the audit and organizational buy-in can be had simply by
  showing how password cracking works, and how far outside of the office the
  wireless network can be seen. Once an organization is using vulnerable
  authentication method, you can flag it right away as "finding". Given that the
  recommendations are often the same (move to WPA2 (and WPA3 as available),
  disable WEP and WPS access, provide a separate guest network, etc.), this
  should rarely be used during an audit (but is a useful skill to practice and
  understand how it works). If you do choose to use this during an audit, be
  aware that many of the stps disrupt network traffic, and success with WPA2
  password cracking is by no means guaranteed, so can backfire.

  By walking organizations through the vulnerabilities of wireless networks, you
  have the opportunity to discuss password strength, and the power that having
  "offline" access to a password means in terms of brute forcing it, as well as
  the importance of defense in depth even within their trusted work network -
  reducing the services computers and servers are sharing, setting up local
  firewalls on computers, and requiring authentication to access files.

  Even a few minutes of network "sniffing" by an adversary can enable them to
  work offline to reveal the network password.  Knowing this password would let
  someone then access the entire internal network, files shared internally, and
  even change network settings to enable remote access.  While in an ideal
  setup, this would give no further access to sensitive documents, it is not
  uncommon to find shared file folders, or to gain access to the firewall or
  network routers (often set to the default password, because they're only
  accessible from inside the network...).

considerations: |
  *Note:* This section is one of the few sections where the SAFETAG audit does
  go through attack scenarios, from attempting to "break in" to the wireless
  network to testing exposed ethernet jacks for connectivity.

  The reasons for this are threefold.  First, access to an organization's
  internal network tends to reveal sensitive data and "shadow" infrastructures
  (such as dropbox usage) that lead to many recommendations to improve access
  control and discussions of the value of defense in depth.  Second, the
  specific act of breaking the wifi password allows for a discussion on password
  security without attacking any specific user's password. Finally, with
  wireless networks treated as equivalent to wired networks in many offices,
  reminding the organization that wireless networks extend beyond the physical
  walls of the office is useful in discussing password rotation and guest
  network policies.

  Once you have access to the network, you need to first document how you
  managed that and share it with the hosts.  This is a great moment to discuss
  passwords in many cases.
  * Confirm that all devices you are accessing/scanning belong to the organization.
  * Clarify timing and seek permission with staff - some activities can tax the network or cause disruptions.

walk_through: |
  Breaking into network requires specialized tools as well as a significant
  amount of time in capturing authentication packets, and replaying those
  packets back to the wireless access point.

  MAC filtering is a common, but easy to bypass security measure.

  WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) has been found with several vulnerabilities.
  The RC4 algorithm that it uses to generate the keystream for encryption is
  subject to [two separate
  weaknesses](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8aeb/2a27abc2a1d0a8b71047606fbeec0f711e03.pdf).

  On the other hand, WPA/WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is also found to be
  vulnerable to attack known as [KRACK](https://www.krackattacks.com/)(Key
  Reinstallation Attacks) as well as offline (high speed) attacks against the
  password itself. WPS, a common "feature" that is on by default on WPA
  networks, has significant vulnerabilities.

  [WPA3](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/07/wpa3.html), a new
  standard, is built to disallow offline password attacks, making it
  significantly harder to break in to that WPA2 networks. As it becomes
  available and devices support it, it should be a priority upgrade if wifi
  network security is a concern.

  ###### Variant: MAC Filtering Bypass


  Open and MAC-address-filtered wireless access points are not only open to
  anyone within range to join and listen in to, but also do not provide
  protection to those on the network itself, even if they do not "broadcast"
  their name.  These may seem like great ways to prevent unauthorized users from
  accessing your network without resorting to passwords, but they are trivial to
  overcome.

  **Auditing MAC address filtered access point**

  The auditor can easily gain access to an open or MAC address filtered access
  point.
  * MAC-Address Spoofing
    * Start the wireless interface in monitor mode
    * Identify MAC addresses that are on the whitelist
  ```bash
  airodump-ng
  ```
    * Change our MAC address to one that’s on the whitelist
  ```bash
  ifconfig mon0 down
  macchanger -m [MAC ADDRESS IDENTIFIED] mon0
  ifconfig mon0 up
  ```

  ###### Variant: WPA Cracking


  The organization’s wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) protects the network and
  its users with WPA encryption. This is an important security measure, and a
  WPA-protected wireless network is much safer than an unencrypted “open”
  network or a WEP-protected network. (WEP is fundamentally flawed, and
  extremely simple attacks have been widely known for over a decade.) However,
  the ease with an attacker could guess the WPA key, or “WiFi password,” is a
  serious issue, particularly considering its importance as an essential
  perimeter control. An attacker who gains access to the wireless LAN
  immediately bypasses many protections that network administrators, and other
  users of the office network, often take for granted. Put another way, anyone
  able to guess the WPA key is immediately “inside the firewall.”

  Using a laptop and a wireless card with a standard, internal antenna (or using
  a customized smartphone or other small device), an attacker could easily
  position themselves close enough to the office to carry out the first phase of
  this attack, which would only take a few minutes. The second phase, which is
  supposed to be the difficult part, could take even less time. From the privacy
  of their own home or office, the attacker could use a minimally customized
  password dictionary to guess the WPA key .


  <!--For reporting, needs time-to-break WPA password -->


  **Materials Needed**

  * For the (most common) WPA password-based attacks, an already-prepared
  dictionary of words to use to attack the password will be required. See the
  [Password Strength activity](https://safetag.org/activities/password_strength) for guidance on dictionary preparation.

  **Instructions**

  An attacker can crack the office’s WPA key in approximately with a short and
  minimally customized password dictionary based on open information about the
  organization and basic word collections.

  **Step 1:** The attacker customizes their WiFi password dictionary, adding
  phrases related to the subject: organization name, street address, phone
  number, email domain, wireless network name, etc. Common password fragments
  are included, as well: qwerty, 12345, asdf and all four-digit dates back to
  the year 2001, for example, among others. The attacker may then add hundreds
  or thousands of words (in English and/or other relevant languages).

  See the [Password Strength Activity](https://safetag.org/activities/password_strength) for details on password dictionary building
  and usage.

  **Step 2:** The attacker would then begin recording all (encrypted) wireless
  traffic associated with the organization’s access point:

  ```
  $ sudo airodump-ng -c 1 --bssid 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F -w sampleorg_airodump mon0
   CH  1 ][ Elapsed: 12 mins ][ 2012-01-23 12:34 ][ fixed channel mon0: -1
   BSSID              PWR RXQ  Beacons    #Data, #/s  CH  MB   ENC  CIPHER AUTH ESSID
   1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F  -70 100    12345    43210    6   1  12e. WPA2 CCMP   PSK sampleorg
   BSSID              STATION            PWR   Rate    Lost  Packets  Probes
   1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F  01:23:45:67:89:01    0    0e- 0e   186    12345
   1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F  AB:CD:EF:AB:CD:EF    0    1e- 1      0     1234
   1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F  AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF  -76    0e- 1      0     1122
   1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F  A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6  -80    0e- 1      0     4321
  ```

  wifite is also useful for this step, and claims to automatically de-auth (step
  3).

  **Step 3:** Next, the auditor forces a wireless client, possibly chosen at
  random, to disconnect and reconnect (an operation that is nearly always
  invisible to the user).

  In the example below, AB:CD:EF:AB:CD:EF is the MAC address of a laptop that
  was briefly disconnected in this way.

  ```
  $ aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F -c AB:CD:EF:AB:CD:EF mon0
   15:54:48  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F) on channel -1
   15:54:49  Sending 64 directed DeAuth. STMAC: [AB:CD:EF:AB:CD:EF] [ 5| 3 ACKs]
  ```

  The goal of this step is to capture the cryptographic handshake that occurs
  when the targeted client reconnects. Try using different clients if the first
  one doesn't work, or try (physically) moving around.

  This handshake does not contain the WPA key itself, but once the the complete
  handshake process has been seen, the auditor (or a potential attacker) can
  leave the vicinity and run various password cracking tools to try and discover
  the password. While a complete password cracking tutorial is out of scope for
  SAFETAG documentation, below are three strategies:

  **Step 4:** The auditor attempts to discover the WPA password.

  A good wordlist with a few tweaks tends to break an unforunate number of
  passwords.  Using a collection of all english words, all words from the
  language of the organization being audited, plus a combination of all these
  words, plus relevant keywords, addresses, and years tends to crack most wifi
  passwords.

  ```bash
    $ aircrack-ng -w pwdpairs.txt -b 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F sampleorg_airodump*.cap
  ```

  For WPA captures, John can either feed in to an aircrack process or attack a
  capture directly.  For captures, you first have to convert the .cap file (from
  wireshark, wifite, airodump, etc.) to a format that John likes.  The Jumbo
  version we use has conversion tools for this available:

  ```bash
  $wpapcap2john wpa.cap > crackme
  $./john -w:password.lst -fo=wpapsk-cuda crackme
  ```

  **Results**

  Successful password cracking via piping these into aircrack-ng:

  ```
   Opening sampleorg_airodump-01.cap
   Reading packets, please wait...
                                 Aircrack-ng 1.1

      EAPOL HMAC     : F1 DF 09 C4 5A 96 0B AD 83 DD F9 07 4E FA 19 74
  ```

  The fourth line of the above output provides some useful information about the
  effectiveness of a strong WPA key. That rate of approximately 2000 keys per
  second means that a full-on, brute-force attack against a similar-length key
  that was truly random (and therefore immune to dictionary-based attacks) would
  take about 70^9 or 20 trillion seconds, which is well over 600,000 years. Or,
  for those who favor length and simplicity over brevity and complexity, a key
  containing four words chosen from among the 10,000 most common English
  dictionary words would still take approximately 150,000 years to crack (using
  this method on an average laptop).

  It is worth noting that an attacker with the resources and the expertise could
  increase this rate by a factor of a hundred. Using a computer with powerful
  graphical processing units (GPUs) or a cloud computing service like Amazon’s
  EC2, it is possible to test 250,000 or more keys per second. A setup like this
  would still take several lifetimes to guess a strong password, however.

  Regardless, the success of this attack against a wireless network would allow
  an attacker to bypass all perimeter controls, including the network firewall.
  Without access to the office LAN, a non-ISP, non-government attacker would
  have to position themselves on the same network as an external staff member in
  order to exploit any flaws in the organization’s email or file-sharing
  services. With access to the local network, however, that attacker could begin
  carrying out local attacks quite quickly, and from a distance.

  See the [Wireless Range Mapping Activity](https://safetag.org/activities/wireless_range_mapping) for guidance on mapping the reach of
  the Wi-Fi network.

  ###### Variant: WPS PIN Cracking

  WPS was built as an addition to WPA to make it easier to add devices without
  typing in secure passwords, but this ease of use means that a malicious actor
  can pose as a device and effectively reduce the potentially very difficult
  passwords WPA allows down to a simple numeric-only 8 character PIN. Further,
  the WPS system allows an attacker to work on this PIN in two parallel chunks,
  further reducing its security. This, like WEP, is a &quot;live&quot; attack -
  you have to stay connected to the network - but also like WEP, it is a
  guaranteed attack; your brute forcing of the WPS system will eventually (2-10
  hours) allow you network access.

  ##### Recommendation

  ###### Recommendations for non-WPA networks
  Transitioning to WPA networks with strong passwords, even for guest networks,
  is recommended.

  MAC filtering and WEP provide no effective protection for a wifi network. Most
  wifi routers offer WPA encryption as an option, and if this is available it
  should be immediately implemented. Some older routers (and wifi devices) do
  not support WPA. It is highly recommended to upgrade immediately to hardware
  that supports WPA and to eliminate all WEP network access. Very few devices
  still functional do not support WPA2. As WPA3 becomes an option, upgrade to
  that.

  ###### Recommendations for WPA networks

  WPS Pin entry should be disabled on the wireless router, or only enabled
  temporarily to add new devices to the network.

  Choosing a strong WPA key is one of the most important steps toward defending
  an organization’s network perimeter from an adversary with the ability to
  spend some time in the vicinity of the offices. By extension, mitigating this
  vulnerability is critical to the protection of employees and partners (and
  confidential data) from the sort of persistent exposure that eventually brings
  down even the most well-secured information systems.

  The WPA password should be long enough and complex enough to prevent both
  standard dictionary attacks and “brute-force attacks” in which clusters of
  powerful computers work in parallel to test every possible character
  combination. (We recommend 12 or more completely random characters or a
  passphrase that contains four or five—or more—relatively uncommon words.) The
  password should not contain common words, including number sequences,
  especially if they are related to the organization, its employees or its work.

  A guest network, with no local network access and a distinct (possibly easier
  to communicate) password should be available if guests are ever given wifi
  access. Because passwords for guest networks inevitably end up being written
  on whiteboards, given to office visitors and emailed to partners, the guest
  password should also be changed periodically. This does not have to happen
  frequently, but anything less than three or four times per year may be unsafe.
