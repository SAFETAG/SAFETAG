summary: >

  This helps the auditor enumerate threats that the organization is concerned
  about and the internal priorities of them.  At the same time, it enables a
  discussion of how threats can interrelate and helps define the difference
  between a threat and a risk (a threat that has a vulnerability associated with
  it), and the value of mitigation.


  This exercise works well with larger groups, and can be woven in to the Threat
  Identification activity.
overview: >+

  * Split participants into small groups and have them brainstorm on all
  possible threats, writing each on a separate stickie

  * Cluster the stickies to reveal duplicate concerns across the group and
  thematic areas

  * Mark the threats which have occurred

  * Select one threat and arrange other threats, where relevant, as potential
  causes or outcomes of that threat


  **Expected Outputs**


  * List of threats and some level of prioritization based on concern

  * Historical threat information for the organization

  * Improved staff understanding of risk

  * Auditor should be able to fill in the below threat analysis worksheet

materials_needed: |

  * Stickies (ideally 3 colors)
  * Pens/sharpies for participant groups
  * Markers
  * Camera to digitally capture the data
  * Whiteboard or flip-chart
considerations: |2

    * Treat threat and adversary data with the utmost security.
    * Ensure that any physical notes/drawings are erased and destroyed once digitally recorded.
    * Ensure that any digital recordings of this process are kept secure and encrypted.
    * Consider who has physical and visual access to the room where this process takes place, and if the room can be secured if this activity may span long/overnight breaks.

  Also review the Threat Identification exercises below to tailor these to best
  meet your information gathering needs based on your interactions with the
  organization.


  ###### Threat Brainstorming (15 minutes)


  Split participants into small groups.  This grouping is particularly valuable
  for larger organizations, but even for small ones, having multiple separate
  groups helps reveal shared concerns around the threats the staff face.  For a
  group that is too small to group, have each staff member brainstorm by
  themselves.


  Have each group or staff member quickly write down any possible "threat" they
  or the organization face.  Some examples ("kidnapping," "website hacked") can
  help seed this activity.


  If you have multiple colors of stickies, having them categorize threats by
  "physical," "digital," or "other/both" will be useful to show their
  inter-relation.


  Keep reminding participants of the time remaining to keep them brainstorming
  rather than discussing threat details or arguing over whether a threat is
  physical or digital.


  ###### Threat Clustering and Discussion


  After the brainstorming (or other exercises to generate or present a list of
  concerns), gather and cluster the stickies on a wall, revealing duplicate
  concerns across the groups and thematic areas of concern.


  As clusters become clear, ask if any events similar to this threat have
  already happened to the organization?  What was the impact?  Has it happened
  more than once? Regularly?  Mark these threats.


  *Note:* Some of these threats may be traumatic experiences, consider skipping
  public discussion of historical occurrence if many of the threats from the
  brainstorm (or from one person/group in particular) are particularly intense.


  ###### Threat Bow-tie


  Select one of the threats that emerged as a concern from the clustering to
  place at the center of a "bow-tie" like drawing on a whiteboard or flip-chart
  paper.


  Begin asking what other threats identified could come as a result of this
  threat, supplanting the responses from the participants with additional
  threats.  For example, a hacked website could lead to loss of trust by funders
  or partners.  "Chain reactions" can be illustrated as lines of events (loss of
  trust by funders could lead to a loss of funding).  Do the same for what
  threats could lead to the "central" threat - a confiscation of a device could
  lead to email hacking, for example.  Some threats can be both potential causes
  and secondary effects.


  Close out this with a discussion of how every threat is potentially connected
  to both digital and physical impacts.


  ###### Threat Analysis Worksheet


  The auditor should be able to modify and complete a worksheet like the below
  at the end of this process. Particularly advanced organizations may be able to
  fill this out as a survey.


  **Calculative Impact Identification**


  |Threat type|Impact|Likelihood|Risk|

  |-------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-------|

  |**HUMAN THREATS**|||||

  |1. Accidental destruction, modification, disclosure of confidential
  information|||||

  |2. Ignorance: inadequate security awareness, lack of security guidelines,
  lack of proper documentation, lack of knowledge|||||

  |3. Workload: Too many or too few system administrators, highly pressured
  users|||||

  |4. Users may inadvertently give information on security weaknesses to
  attackers|||||

  |5. Incorrect system configuration|||||

  |6. Inadequate security policy|||||

  |7. Dishonesty: Fraud, theft, selling of confidential information|||||

  users/administrators to give user name/passwords, etc|||||

  ||||||

  |**GENERAL THREATS**|||||

  **Risk = Impact * Likelihood**

  |Impact is negligible =1|Unlikely to occur =0||||

  |Effect is minor, major organization operations are not affected=2| Likely to
  occur less than once per year =1||||

  |Organization operations are unavailable for a certain amount of time, costs
  are incurred. Public/customer confidence is minimally affected =3| Likely to
  occur once per year =2||||

  |Significant loss of operations, significant impact on public/customer
  confidence =4| likely to occur once per month =3||||

  |Effect is disastrous, systems are down for an extended period of time,
  rebuilding and replacement of systems is required =5| Likely to occur once per

  |Effect is catastrophic, critical systems are completely down for an extended
  period; data is lost or irreparably corrupted; public and customers are
  totally affected =6| Likely to occur daily =5||||
