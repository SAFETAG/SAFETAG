summary: |
  The auditor checks for the type of mobile devices in the organizations
  Follows a series of steps depending on the different mobile devices.

  The key considerations with regards to mobile devices are the user, the type
  of device, and the data it manages. Ensure that:
  - data on the devices is kept secure;
  - the organization has a policy for securing mobile devices;
  - the devices are configured with recommended and consistent (across the
  organization) security settings;
  - the organization has control over and a way of tracking any mobile devices
  which it pays for and issues (as opposed to personal devices).

  Consider all of the above points when writing your report.
overview: |
  * Identify what mobile devices are in the organization. Are they organizational owned or personal?
  * Decide the scope of the mobile device assessment (ie will it cover personal devices or only organizational resources; how many devices can access the organization's assets and will all be covered?)
  * Check whether there are any policies and procedures (formal or informal) on mobile device use
  * Identify the control measures in place and responsibility levels.

materials_needed: |
  * A notepad, pen. Also an already prepared list of different kinds of mobile
  devices
considerations: |
  * Communicate clearly to the staff members the level of access needed for the
  audit. Explain what you will be able to see and what you won't be able to see.
  Make sure to obtain explicit consent and explain in detail what you'll look into
  if personal devices will be checked.

  NB: The auditor should not access any personal mobile device without its owner
  present. Even then, the auditor must explain every step in great detail. Ideally,
  the auditor could ask individuals to check certain settings on their devices
  (such as passcode length or OS version) and report back. If the auditor needs to
  touch personal mobile devices, they must obtain explicit consent before doing so.
walk_through: |
  The auditor confirms the number and nature of mobile devices that the
  organization owns. The auditor should keep within the agreed scope. But in the
  case where multiple mobile devices outside the agreed scope access the
  organizations' resources, then redefining of the scope may be necessary.
  Auditor should also consider checking mobile devices against a device 
  security checklist.

  As you work with staff members, also remember to interview them about the
  devices they use. This can alternate between mobile devices and non-mobile
  devices.

  Below are some guiding questions to use. And this is an opportunity for the
  auditor to go deeper into any area concerning devices.

  Guiding questions:

  * What categories of mobile devices does the organization have? (eg, laptops,
  smartphones, external drives, cameras, recording devices, etc)

  * What are they primarily used for?

  * What data is stored on the devices and who has access to them?

  * Are the devices provided by organization or do staff use personal devices
  for official work? (Auditor: Review the props and cons of each set up)

  * What are the risks involved with using each of the mobile devices?

  * What is the impact of their use to the organization's work?

  * Does the organization have specific policies and procedures concerning
  mobile devices? (eg; policy on use, encryption, location services, access
  control, password standards, etc)

  * If yes; Do the policies and procedures define the access level to
  organizational devices and also for personal devices?

  * What is the policy on using untrusted networks?

  * What are the procedures for interacting with mobile systems which are  not
  owned by the organization?

  * What are the existing in/formal security practices for these devices? What
  are the physical security measures? What are the digital security measures?

  * Which mobile phone OS are staff using? What are the props and cons of each?

  * Is there someone in-charge of the devices and their security? (NB:Auditor:
  This checks on the capacity of the organization)

  * What applications are installed? (Auditor note: check the device assessment
  checklist for the technical aspects)

  * What are the users' perceptions towards the installed applications on their
  devices? (Auditor: Review the perception vs reality check findings)

  * What security software if any is installed on the devices? Does it offer
  remote wipe functions? Who is able to trigger such a remote wipe?

  * Are the users aware of security software or remote wipe functions on
  personal or work-issued mobile devices?

  * What resources (financial, staff time) does the organization need in
  order to maintain or manage devices?
