summary: |
  The auditor checks for the type of mobile devices in the organizations
  Follows a series of steps depending on the different mobile devices.

  The key considerations with regards to mobile devices are the user, the type
  of device, and the data it manages.
  - the data is kept secure;
  - device is configured with the recommended security settings;
  - the organizational policies and procedures with regards to mobile devices;
  - In case of organization owned devices, that management has control over its
  facilitates.

  These considerations contribute to the development of the report component.
overview: |
  * Identify what mobile devices are in the organization. Are they organizational owned or personal?
  * Decide the scope of the mobile device assessment (ie will it cover personal devices or only organizational resources; number of devices)
  * Check for existence and status of any policies and procedures (formal or informal)
  * Identify the control measures in place and responsibility levels.

materials_needed: |
  * A notepad, pen. Also an already prepared list of different kinds of mobile
  devices

considerations: |
  * Communicate clearly to the staff members the level of access needed for the
  audit and obtain their consent in case personal devices are being checked i.e.
  explain that it may involve access of private data on their personal devices.

  NB: The auditor should not access any personal mobile device absence of the
  owner of the device and any step taken should be explained before being
  implemented.
walk_through: |
  The auditor confirms the number and nature of mobile devices that the
  organization owns. The auditor should keep within the agreed scope. But in the
  case where multiple mobile devices outside the agreed scope access the
  organizations' resources, then redefining of the scope may be necessary.
  Auditor should also consider the instructions under the device checklist.

  As you work with staff members, also remember to interview them about the
  devices they use. This can alternate between mobile devices and non-mobile
  devices.

  Below are some guiding questions to use. And this is an opportunity for the
  auditor to go deeper into any area concerning devices.

  Guiding questions:

  * What categories of mobile devices does the organization have? (eg, laptops,
  phones, external drives, cameras, recording devices, etc)

  * What are they primarily used for?

  * What data is stored on the devices and who has access to them?

  * Are the devices provided by organization or do staff use personal devices
  for official work? (Auditor: Review the pros and cons of each set up)

  * Does the organization use some type of mobile device management (MDM) or
  conditional access solution? If so, is it for just work-issued devices or also
  personal devices which connect to organizational resources?

  * Do all the mobile devices which access organizational resources have
  up-to-date software? Is there a policy for replacing devices which can no
  longer receive software updates?

  * What are the risks involved with using each of the mobile devices? (NB:
  Auditor should know at least 2 risk for each of the devices in use)

  * What is the impact of their use to the organization's work?

  * Does the organization have specific policies and procedures concerning
  mobile devices? (eg; policy on use, encryption, location services, access
  control, password standards, etc)

  * If yes; Do the policies and procedures define the access level to
  organizational devices and also for personal devices?

  * What are the procedures for interacting with mobile systems which are not
  owned by the organization?

  * Is there someone in-charge of the devices and their security? (NB:Auditor:
  This checks on the capacity of the organization)

  * What applications are installed? (Auditor note: check the device assessment
  checklist for the technical aspects)

  * What are the users' perception towards the installed applications on their
  devices? (Auditor: Review the perception vs reality check findings)

  * What security software if any are installed on the devices? Does it offer
  remote wipe functions?

  * Are the users aware of them? (Examine the different categories separately)

  * What is the financial implication of maintaining these devices?
