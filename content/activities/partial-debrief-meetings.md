summary: This activity will help the auditor to organize periodic calls or
  meetings to share relevant information about the audit without waiting for the
  end of it. This is particularly designed for audits that are conducted over
  longer timeframes (taking two or more weeks for instance).
short_summary: " "
overview: >
 Depending on the audit, the auditor or the organization might be interested in convening periodically to share progress and align on the direction the audit is taking at specific points of time. In addition, once most core assessment activities are concluded, the auditor will have a good sense of the actual security context of the organization, and even before finalizing the recommendation roadmap, will have an idea of some of the most relevant recommendations that will be included in the final report. This activity aims to help the auditor create spaces for ongoing exchange updates in a structured way.

 Also, by this point, the organization might also have anticipation of knowing what the auditor found, questions like “Are we secure enough?” or “Do we need to address something ASAP because we are too vulnerable today?” are common after most of the assessment activities are over
 
 This activity is especially useful in case of remote audits, where the points of contact usually don’t have the visibility of the activities being conducted in the way that might happen in person, and also in the case of audits that are conducted during a long time (whether remote or in-person) where after some days or weeks it becomes more difficult to keep track of the progress of the audit, activities still pending, and relevant findings so far.

Considerations: |
  Even when the activity suggests synchronous spaces for the
  partial debriefs, these might also happen over other channels like emails, chats, or other asynchronous spaces as long as they work for both the organization and the auditor. When there are more sensitive topics to discuss that can affect the course of the audit, the organization’s operations, or involve sensitive information; there is the possibility of organizing a synchronous space like a call or an in-person meeting.
walk_through: >-
  1. **Define the frequency and convening space of these partial debriefs with
  the organization :** These might happen daily, weekly, as requested, etc.
  Also, they might happen in person or virtually depending on the possibilities.


  2. **Before each partial debrief, gather data on the activities conducted:** This information can be from the last partial debrief or in general to recount all the progress so far on each meeting. The information might include which activities were conducted and finished, potential roadblocks to start new activities, interesting vulnerabilities and recommendations that the organization can act upon immediately, and any responsive support given so far (please check the Responsive support method for more information on this).


  3. **During the partial debrief, share the information above:** The auditor can give priority to more pressing aspects like urgent recommendations or roadblocks.


  4. **Depending on the discussion during the partial debrief, adjust the audit plan:** To reflect any changes the auditor and/or the organization want to make moving forward during the audit process.


  5. **After the partial debrief, share any changes to the audit plan made in the previous step:** so there is a support that will help both parties to confirm the change given that this can involve changing the scope initially agreed for the audit.
recommendations: "* It is advised to hold a general debrief following this
  activity regardless of conducting partial ones. For instance, the last partial
  debrief might follow the structure of a formal final debrief to give a closure
  to the core audit process before building the implementation roadmap and the
  final report."
