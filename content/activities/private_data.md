  **Personal Information To Keep Private**

  Information that can be used to identify individuals, organizations, and even
  communities of practice should be treated with the utmost care. Some data,
  like names, phone numbers, and addresses are obvious, while others, like
  computer names, or pseudonymous social media accounts may be less obvious.
  Also, combinations of information - location, data, and type of activity,
  or even an issue area of interest and a city name may be enough to narrow
  down individuals or organizations.

recommendations: |
  During the internal audit, think of what information could be considered
  particularly private. List the types of information (without listing the
  contents), and highlight it in your audit report.

  Please refer to the Analysis and Reporting section for the limited data set
  that is required for project reporting, and to the Operational Security
  section for guidance on data security.
