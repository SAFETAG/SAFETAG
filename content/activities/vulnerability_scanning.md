summary: |
  While much of SAFETAG focuses on digital security challenges within and around
  the office, remote attacks on the organization's website, extranets, and
  unintended information available from "open sources" all pose real threats and
  deserve significant attention.  SAFETAG takes great care to take a very
  passive approach to this work, especially when done off-site, so as not to
  have unintended consequences on the organization's infrastructure or undermine
  operational security concerns.

  This activity uses active research and scanning to detect known
  vulnerabilities in external and key internal services. Usually penetration
  tests exploit possible vulnerabilities to confirm their existence.
  [^NIST_exploit_confirm] But, the use of exploits puts the organization's
  systems at a level of increased risk [^NIST_pen_test_danger] that is
  unacceptable when neither the organization nor the auditor has the time or
  finances to address the issue. The SAFETAG methodology only uses relatively
  safe exploitation of vulnerabilities for targeted outcomes. For instance,
  cracking the wireless access point password allows us to demonstrate the
  importance of good passwords without singling out any individual's passwords.

overview: |
  * Identify services being hosted or used by an organization
  * Research externally-facing organization services (websites, services hosted
  from the office, etc.)
  * Research information about identified services (e.g current versions of
  those services.)
  * Run vulnerability scans against websites hosted by the organization,
  externally facing servers run by the organization, and key intranet servers.
materials_needed: |
  * A Kali VM, bootable USB, or installed system with ZAP or OpenVAS
  installed, updated, and running\
considerations: |
  * Be very careful about which automated scans you run to ensure that no
  aggressive or potentially damaging tests are included.
  * OpenVAS saves its scan records in /var/lib/openvas/mgr/tasks.db - this file
  will contain sensitive data, ensure it is stored securely.
  * OpenVAS and other vulnerability scanners can be highly aggressive in their
  tactics.  Tools like Metasploit come with a library of active, functional
  exploits to "prove" that a system is actively vulnerable.  As such, these can
  be tricky to use.  Even OpenVAS on a safe-only scan can appear to a host as an
  active attack, blocking further access from your IP (this can cause some
  annoyance if you are, for example, scanning your host organization's website
  from their network).  Some of these scans and techniques -- again, even the
  "safe" ones -- can also be a violation of local hacking laws.  Get explicit
  permission, give warnings, and be careful.

  ###### Vulnerability Scanning using OpenVAS


  **Setting up OpenVAS in Kali**

  ```
  openvas initial setup
  openvas feed update
  openvas check setup
  openvas stop
  openvas start
  ```

  Visit [https://127.0.0.1:9392/](https://127.0.0.1:9392/) in a web browser and
  log in.

  **Using OpenVAS**

  Once logged in to OpenVAS, the interface is disturbingly simple to use.  For
  most use, using the Wizard to scan the target server works best.  Things to
  verify before doing so:

  * Check the Scan defaults for the Wizard - it should be set to run the
  built-in "Full and Fast" scan
  * For that scan, verify (under Configuration->Scan Configs) that the "Scan
  Settings" list shows "safe_checks" as "yes"

  Once you start a scan, change the display to "auto refresh" to give you more
  feedback on the scan process. Once the scan is completed, a report can be
  exported in PDF form.

  **Common problems**
  * **Errors during openvas-start** OpenVAS is a rather ... delicate program.
  Most often, the openvas-start script will not wait long enough between
  launching openvassd and openvasmd, causing openvasmd to error out. Re-running
  openvasmd often works, though an entire stop/start cycle seems to be slightly
  more reliable.  Often, openvasmd will error out, but launch anyway.  Checking
  the web interface at https://127.0.0.1:9392 to make sure that you can log in
  is the best way to check if it's actually successfully launched.
  * **Lost admin password** From a root command-line, you can reset the web
  interface's admin password:
  ```
  openvasmd --create-user=admin
  openvasmd --user=admin --new-password=admin
  ```
  * **openvasmd will never launch** In many fresh install cases of OpenVAS7, the
  openVAS self-signed CA certificate is set to an invalid date, which also
  causes openvasmd to error out. The check-setup script will recommend
  rebuilding the database, but the /var/log/openvas/openvasmd.log may have
  errors discussing certificate errors.  If this is the case, try:
  ```
  rm /var/lib/openvas/CA/*
  rm /var/lib/openvas/private/CA/*
  openvas-mkcert
  openvas-mkcert-client -n -i
  openvas-check-setup
  openvas-start
  openvasmd --rebuild
  openvas-stop
  openvas-start
  ```

recommendations: |
  The auditor will need to do research and compare against the organization's
  capacity and risks to give specific recommendations based on the
  vulnerabilities discovered in the process.  Some common recommendations
  include the following:

  * Out of Date Content Manangement System: **See also recommendations in the
  [Website Footprinting Activity](https://safetag.org/activities/web_footprint)**
  * Insecure Website Login: **See also recommendations in the [Insecure Website
  Login Activity](https://safetag.org/activities/insecure_website_login)**
  * Website Vulnerabilities: **See also recommendations in the [Web Vulnerability
  Assessment Activity](https://safetag.org/activities/web_vulnerability_assessment)**
