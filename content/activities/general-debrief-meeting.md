summary: |
  In this activity, after the core audit activities are completed and a report and recommendations (potentially in draft stage) are ready, the auditor will create a space to share back to the organization the main findings, assets and processes that were included  or excluded from the scope, pressing vulnerabilities, and recommendations (especially those that can be addressed right away), and any next steps. This provides a valuable touch-point for the organization to read the report and ask any clarifying questions to the auditor, as well as for the auditor to underscore any important steps for the organization. 

  This meeting may take place before or after a 'final' report and roadmap are completed. Holding this meeting before completion allows for sharing of more initial findings and incorporation of more feedback. In other cases this may not be suitable to the audit timeline and may take place after the report is finalized, though the auditor should allow for changes or errata if needed by the host organization. 
short_summary: "Present a complete or near-complete report and set of recommendations to the organization including an overview of the audit process."
overview: >
 
  To set the stage to give the organization some reassurance and potentially homework while the report is built, enabling a space to talk to them and walk them through what the auditor did will be important; this is precisely the idea behind this activity: organizing an in-person or virtual meeting with key stakeholders from the organization to, among other things, set the tone for upcoming communications, define points of contact moving forward (for the report delivery and follow-up), share what was done during the responsive support activities, and what immediate-term aspects they should address next.

Considerations: |
  * In many cases, this activity can be conducted in coordination with a
  training session as part of the “Responsive support” stage. So, the covered content can be aligned with any major vulnerabilities and recommendations proposed during the debrief.  

  * For some organizations receiving security audits, the debrief is even more important than the actual report because it is usually delivered in a more synchronous way and allows to be more concrete and to answer questions that the organization might have right away.
walk_through: >-
  **In advance of the session, send the draft or final report**, to allow time for personnel present to review it and gather their thoughts.
  
  Prepare a presentation and discussion points, including the following:
  
  1. **Gather the list of activities executed:** Especially those that were not
  directly observed by the organization like remote scans or desk research.

  2. **By activity, gather the list of main recommendations and vulnerabilities:** especially those that are more relevant to be addressed in the immediate and short term, or those that might have a high impact on the organization’s security.

  3. **Gather the list of works/interventions conducted in responsive in-audit support:** this could include for example group training, one-on-one help on specific topics during the interviews, configuration of services/accounts/devices, modifications made to the website with the help of IT staff if applicable, etc. Please refer to the responsive support method to get more information.


  4. **Formulate next steps:** these might include implementing specific recommendations that are urgent or require low effort, communicate with specific organizations to follow up with specialized threats, and review specific capacity building materials that will help the organization to move forward with the implementation of the roadmap.


  **Coordinate a call or meeting with the organization:** Ideally this space should be synchronous (in-person or on an online call) and will occur during or right after the core audit activity period. During the call or meeting, **share the information listed above.** The auditor might try to focus on specific aspects if there are many potential items to discuss, to help the organization to concentrate on the most important aspects to consider right after the audit and before receiving the final report.Each organization, and often even each key point of contact within the organization, will want to explore the report in different ways.  Adapt to the
  needs of the organization, but make sure you cover the top-priority
  recommendations that the organization needs to consider in the immediate
  future.

  **Answer the questions they might have** and **discuss follow-up** steps from both the auditor and host organization.
recommendations: >-
  * Some auditors use this activity to facilitate a space to discuss or
  “co-create” the criteria to be followed in the implementation roadmap to be
  developed for the final report, making the audit’s final product more valuable
  to the organization and more likely to be implemented.  

  * There are various ways of executing the walk-through: some might prepare a comprehensive document and others might do a mental list. Adapt this activity to your style, skills and what you think is the best to communicate with the organization.
