summary: >
  Schedule and have a follow up call to discuss the audit report.  This provides
  a valuable touch-point for the organization to read the report and ask any
  clarifying questions to the auditor, as well as for the auditor to underscore
  any important steps for the organization.  
overview: |

  * Walk through the report and discuss the priority findings
  * Schedule a long-term check-in call
materials_needed: |

  * A copy of the report
  * A secure note-taking system.
considerations: >

  * A secure, real-time VOIP system is recommended for this call, as many of the
  highly sensitive audit findings are likely to be discussed in detail.  Skype
  may suffice in some regions, but also consider secure call options
  (https://ostel.co/).
walk_through: >

  Each organization, and often even each key point of contact within the
  organization, will want to explore the report in different ways.  Adapt to the
  needs of the organization, but make sure you cover the top-priority
  recommendations that the organization needs to consider in the immediate
  future.


  Ask the organization to fill out Staff Feedback Surveys.


  Ask if they need any specific resources or introductions not included in the
  report.


  At the end of the call, schedule a second follow-up call to check in on their
  progress.
