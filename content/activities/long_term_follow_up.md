summary: |
  Follow up with host after a few months to check on progress, get long-term
  feedback and connect with any new resources.
overview: ''
materials_needed: |
  * A copy of the report
  * A secure note-taking system.
considerations: |
  * We recommend conducting this call through a secure system such as Signal call,
  Jitsi, Google Meet, or Zoom rather than through a standard phone line. The former
  all have transport encryption and, in some cases, end-to-end encryption as well.
walk_through: |
  This can be combined with the Staff Feedback Survey exercise, or to follow up
  on any concerns you have based on their responses to that survey.  The main
  goal of the long-term follow-up is to ensure that the organization has ongoing
  connection points to any resources or connections they need to remove barriers
  to adoption.
