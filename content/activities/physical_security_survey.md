summary: >
  This activity helps the auditor assess the organization's current operational
  security policies and practices through in-person or remote surveys and/or
  interviews. By also requesting to review and official policies as well as
  conducting multiple iterations of this with different staff members, some
  basic verification of the practices and awareness/understanding of existing
  policies can be achieved
overview: >
  The auditor interviews and/or requests survey input from organizational
  representatives, requests supporting documentation (e.g. policies) as
  relevant, and iterates/repeats as needed.


  This activity is used to solidify the auditor's understanding of the physical
  risks the organization faces in its work as they impact information security:


  * Discuss potential risks and history

  * Explore the physical office setup

  * Determine access controls and related policies (who has access to what,
  when?)

  * Determine where and when staff members work (office, cafe, co-working
  spaces, home, on travel/remote assignments)


  This can be done entirely remotely over secure communications channels (see
  operational security considerations), and may be useful to be done partially
  or fully in advance of an in-person audit to further understand operational
  risks of traveling to the office location.
materials_needed: >

  * (optional) Survey system with appropriate security precautions and access
  controls

  * Note-taking device that can be secured.

  * For remote support, a secure videochat system (such as Signal) which works
  with the available bandwidth.
considerations: >

  * Any physical notes taken on physical security should be destroyed. Digital
  notes should be kept in line with overall SAFETAG standards.

  * Consider the threat context if an online survey tool is used to collect
  information and manage data access and storage responsibly.

  * Any remote communication on physical security should be done over secured
  channels from a private space

  * It should be noted that SAFETAG is focused only on the digital impacts of
  physical security.  This guide does not provide a full physical security
  assessment.
walk_through: >
  This activity should build on the preparation work of the auditor, as well as
  the capacity assessment and  context research work:


  * **Capacity Assessment:** If the auditor has already completed the Capacity
  Assessment interview, many of the answers from its introductory "Open Up"
  questions (5-22) provide threat history, likelihood, and some basic policy
  information, and the questions grouped as "Threat Information," (58-68) go
  deeper into previous problems and responses.  If those were not asked, they
  can be included here as a follow-up interview/survey.

  * **Context Research:** Ensure context research has revealed whether the
  organization would be targeted by adversaries due to their work (e.g.
  advocacy, engagement in or media coverage of socially sensitive topics, etc.).
  Threat identification and technical context research should  provide insight
  into likely technical capabilities of adversaries (are malware or other
  surillance tools used (https://sii.transparencytoolkit.org/) ? Physical
  surveillance/monitoring? Keyloggers?)


  Once an initial interview or survey has taken place (as part of capacity
  assessment or dedicated to the above-mentioned questions), Send a follow-up
  request for any policies mentioned or referred to (travel policies,
  onboarding/offboarding policies for staff changes, personal device usage
  ("BYOD") policies, etc.). After reviewing those documents, request any
  additional policies those may refer to (general IT or security policies),
  and/or schedule a follow up interview or informal survey to dig deeper into
  remaining unanswered questions on the operatioal security situation of the
  organization as well as their adaptations to it.  In the (likely) case where
  there are no policies governing these topics, the auditor can ask their points
  of contact for these discussions what the general practices are and expand and
  verify this through additional activities.


  In creating new questions, be careful to not "lead" on security in a way that
  would discourage honest and transparent responses.  For example, ask "Do you
  host community events and trainings?" instead of "Do you allow outside people
  into your office"?


  Below are questions not already covered in the capacity assessment interview
  process, and after that selected questions from that process which are of
  particular use here.


  **Office layout and proximity concerns**


  Describe your office - is it on a floor of a building? An entire floor? (What
  level of the building?) How close are other buildings? Is it a shared, open
  office space or co-working space? (shared network? open access?)?


  Has the organization dealt with robberies/theft, break-ins, or office raids? 
  If so, what happened, when, and how did you respond (or do you have a policy
  or contingency plan? When was that last reviewed/updated?)


  What other wifi networks can you see? (See https://wigle.net/ )
