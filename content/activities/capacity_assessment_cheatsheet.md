summary: |
  A monolithic, one-time interview with key staff is not always possible or
  advisable, but interacting with a variety of staff exposes valuable
  information about every aspect of the audit, from vulnerabilities to capacity
  to hidden barriers.  This serves as a "cheat sheet" of some topics to explore
  both during the planning and preparation phase and throughout the audit
  process.
