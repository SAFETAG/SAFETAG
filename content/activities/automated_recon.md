  This component allows the auditor to quickly identify publicly available
  resources (such as websites, extranets, email servers, but also social media
  information) connected to the organization and remotely gather information
  about those resources.

  While much of SAFETAG focuses on digital security challenges within and around
  the office, remote attacks on the organization's website, extranets, and
  unintended information available from "open sources" all pose real threats and
  deserve significant attention.  SAFETAG takes great care to take a very
  passive approach to this work, especially when done off-site, so as not to
  have unintended consequences on the organization's infrastructure or undermine
  operational security concerns.

  This remote work also feeds in to the Auditor's understanding of the
  organization's digital presence (and their own understanding thereof), and
  will guide specific vulnerabilities to investigate once on site.

  * Use VPNs to do automated searching. The automated process can be misconstrued by various services as malicious and cause your local network to get blocked, filtered, or surveilled. Tor is often blocked by the tools you will be using.
walk_through: |
  Both Recon-ng and Foca are open source reconnaissance tools with many
  available plugins. Foca is, out-of-the-box, more aimed at extracting metadata
  from documents and images, whereas Recon is slightly more focused on finding
  digging into domains, subdomains, contacts, and the more network-level
  information.  Both tools are best used in addition to critical thinking and
  manual exploration, and require "seed" inputs to get started and careful
  curation to remove false leads.

  ###### Variant: Recon-ng

  **What is recon-ng?**

  recon-ng is an interactive command-line application written in python which is
  used to carry out reconnaissance using various open source intelligence
  resources. It offers a library of modules to carry out various searches using
  existing knowledge such as a website domain, an IP, an email address, a name,
  or a geographic location. Some modules require usage of a service API which
  you will need to obtain yourself (some of these are free with usage
  limitations while others must be paid for). Usage of the modules will populate
  dynamic database tables with information of interest such as personnel
  contacts, usernames, emails, technical information like hosts, IPs, and ports,
  and password hashes or plaintexts.

  **Installing recon-ng**

  Follow installation instructions from [Recon-ng Getting Started
  Instructions](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng/wiki/Getting-Started#installation).
  Note that recon-ng is already included in Kali Linux and Parrot.

  **Using recon-ng**
  Below is a walkthrough on using recon-ng v5, but there is also a good introductory recon-ng V5 video series at [Recon-ng v5 series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBf0hzazHTGOg9taK90uFjdcb8UgGfRKZ)
  **Interface Basics**

  Run recon-ng from the command line:

  ```
  # recon-ng
  ```

  By pressing the tab key twice you can use auto-completion to see the available
  options. This is a good way to familiarize yourself with the commands and
  navigation. On a new installation, pressing tab twice will display:

  ```
  [recon-ng][default] |
  back         db           help         keys         modules      pdb         
  shell        snapshots    workspaces   exit         index        marketplace
  options      script       show         spool
  ```

  These are the first level of commands

  Autocomplete (pressing tab) works even inside commands:

  ```
  [recon-ng][default] > show
  banner           credentials      hosts            locations       
  options          schema
  companies        dashboard        keys             modules         
  ports            vulnerabilities
  contacts         domains          leaks            netblocks       
  pushpins         workspaces
  ```


  **Adding recon modules**

  recon-ng v5 does not come with any modules pre-installed but contains a
  marketplace from which you can search and install individual modules.

  Typing ```marketplace search``` will list all modules in the marketplace. Note
  that modules have a specific name format which helps the user understand the
  flow of data inside the tool. Remember that recon-ng organises information
  into a number of database tables such as domains, hosts, contacts, leaks.
  Modules use the syntax ```<methodology step>/<input table>-<output
  table>/<module>```.  The inputs are the first part of each module, and the
  outputs are the second part. The module name itself is the tool used to
  process the data.  So, recon/domains-hosts/brute-hosts takes domain names
  (websitename.org) as an input, and outputs hostnames
  (extranet.websitename.org, etc.).  If you provide the name of the specific
  module, recon-ng can figure it out (though tab completion doesn't help) -- for
  example, ``` marketplace info threatminer``` works just as well as
  ```marketplace info recon/domains-hosts/threatminer```

  Typing ```marketplace search``` will display all modules in the marketplace.
  You can also search for a specific word or input/output table such as
  ```marketplace search DNS``` or ```marketplace search hosts```.

  If you want to read what a module does before installing it then execute
  ```marketplace info <modulename>```

  The results of the search query look like this:

  ```
  [recon-ng][default] > marketplace search DNS
  [*] Searching module index for 'DNS'...

  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  D = Has dependencies. See info for details.
  K = Requires keys. See info for details.
  ```
  As explained in the search results legend, a module with a * in the D column
  has dependencies which will be listed if you check the module info.
  Dependencies can be installed outside of recon-ng using ```pip install
  <dependency_name>```. Modules with a * in the K column require an API key,
  explained below.

  Install a module with ```marketplace install <module_name>``` or install all
  modules with ```marketplace install all``` though modules with missing
  dependencies and missing API keys will not work until you address those needs.
  You can also install a collection of modules by using commands like
  ```marketplace install recon``` to install all the recon/* modules, or
  ```marketplace install recon/domains-hosts``` to get all of the domains-hosts
  modules under recon.

  **First steps**

  NOTE: This walkthrough is using sample data. Results will vary widely
  depending on the organization you are working with.

  recon-ng lets you set up separate workspaces to organise your reconnaissance
  work. This will likely be used to separate results and findings for
  reconnaissance on different organisations. Different workspaces maintain
  separate results database tables.
  * Create a workspace for your recon.
  ```
  [recon-ng][default] > workspaces add websitename
  [recon-ng][websitename] |
  ```
  * Note that you can also switch workspaces during the recon.
  ```
  [recon-ng][websitename] > workspaces load default
  [recon-ng][default] |
  [recon-ng][default] > workspaces load websitename
  [recon-ng][websitename] |
  ```
  * Add known seed information (domains, netblocks, company names, locations, etc.)
  Start off with information you already know about the organisation you are
  conducting reconnaissance on.

  Display possible seed information by using auto-completion - type the command
  below followed by tapping tab twice:

  ```
  [recon-ng][websitename] > db insert
  companies        credentials      hosts            locations       
  ports            pushpins         vulnerabilities
  contacts         domains          leaks            netblocks       
  profiles         repositories
  ```

  We will only use the organization's name, one domain, two netblocks (that we
  got by searching for other domains and ping-ing them), and two e-mails of the
  company we are looking for so we will add those.

  First, add the company name.

  ```
  [recon-ng][websitename] > db insert companies
  company (TEXT): Websitename
  description (TEXT):
  ```

  Next, add the domain. You can then use the ```show``` command to see the data
  you have entered or collected in that table.

  ```
  [recon-ng][websitename] > db insert domains
  domain (TEXT): websitename.org
  notes (TEXT):
  [*] 1 rows affected.
  [recon-ng][websitename] > show domains
  +------------------------------------------------+
  | rowid |      domain     | notes |    module    |
  +------------------------------------------------+
  | 1     | websitename.org |       | user_defined |
  +------------------------------------------------+
  [*] 1 rows returned

  ```

  Next, add any contacts. we don't know much. But, we will add what we know.

  ```
  [recon-ng][websitename] > db insert contacts
  first_name (TEXT): Bob
  middle_name (TEXT): Pirate
  last_name (TEXT): Smith
  email (TEXT): bpsmith@websitename.org
  title (TEXT): Compliance Manager
  region (TEXT):
  country (TEXT): USA
  phone (TEXT):
  notes (TEXT):
  [*] 1 rows affected.

  [recon-ng][websitename] > db insert contacts
  first_name (TEXT): Susan
  middle_name (TEXT):
  last_name (TEXT): Mirembe
  email (TEXT): smirembe@websitename.org
  title (TEXT): Chief of Party
  region (TEXT):
  country (TEXT): USA
  phone (TEXT):
  notes (TEXT):
  [*] 1 rows affected.
  ```

  Finally we will add the ip address of their website.

  ```
  [recon-ng][websitename] > db insert netblocks
  netblock (TEXT): 96.127.170.252
  notes (TEXT): Public website IP
  [*] 1 rows affected.
  [recon-ng][websitename] > db insert netblocks
  netblock (TEXT): 96.127.170.121
  notes (TEXT): Public website IP
  [*] 1 rows affected.
  ```

  Here it is in the database.

  ```
  [recon-ng][websitename] > show netblocks
  +-----------------------------------------------------------+
  | rowid |    netblock    |       notes       |    module    |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------+
  | 1     | 96.127.170.252 | Public website IP | user_defined |
  | 2     | 96.127.170.121 | Public website IP | user_defined |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------+
  [*] 2 rows returned

  ```

  **Reconnaissance phase (netblocks example)**
  * Run modules that leverage known netblocks. This exposes other domains and hosts from which domains can be harvested.
  First, search for any modules that use netblocks as an input.

  ```
  [recon-ng][websitename] > marketplace search netblocks-
  [*] Searching module index for 'netblocks-'...
  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  |                  Path                 | Version |     Status    |  Updated   | D | K |

  | recon/netblocks-hosts/reverse_resolve | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   |   |
  | recon/netblocks-hosts/shodan_net      | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   | * |
  | recon/netblocks-hosts/virustotal      | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   | * |
  | recon/netblocks-ports/census_2012     | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   |   |
  | recon/netblocks-ports/censysio        | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   | * |
  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  ```

  In the case of ```recon/netblocks-hosts/reverse_resolve``` we can see that the
  "reverse_resolve" module is a reconnaissance module that takes in netblocks
  and produces hosts.

  Lets install it  with ```marketplace install
  recon/netblocks-hosts/reverse_resolve``` or just ```marketplace install
  reverse_resovle```.

  Now we can load that module to use it

  ```
  [recon-ng][websitename] > modules load recon/netblocks-hosts/reverse_resolve
  [recon-ng][websitename][reverse_resolve] |
  ```

  An empty command line can be daunting. Use the ```info``` command to learn
  about the module and see what options are available.

  ```
  [recon-ng][websitename][reverse_resolve] > info
      Name: Reverse Resolver
    Author: John Babio (@3vi1john)
   Version: 1.0
  Description:
  Conducts a reverse lookup for each of a netblock's IP addresses to resolve the hostname. Updates the
  'hosts' table with the results.
  Options:
  Name    Current Value  Required  Description
  ------  -------------  --------  -----------
  SOURCE  default        yes       source of input (see 'info' for details)
  Source Options:
  default        SELECT DISTINCT netblock FROM netblocks WHERE netblock IS NOT NULL
  <string>       string representing a single input
  <path>         path to a file containing a list of inputs
  query <sql>    database query returning one column of inputs
  ```

  Notice how the current value of SOURCE is 'default'? Then look at the source
  options - the default behaviour is to run the module on all netblocks found
  within the netblock table which we have already begun to populate in the last
  step. There are other options such as resolving one particular IP by changing
  the source using ```options set SOURCE 8.8.8.8```, or using an input file or a
  custom database query. In this walkthrough, we will use the default behaviour
  which takes the current contents of netblocks as input. Now, use ```run``` to
  run the module .

  ```

  * Run modules that conduct DNS brute forcing of TLDs and sub-domains against
  current domains.

  Reconnaissance is all about turning existing information into more
  information. You may start with something as simple as a company name, like
  ACME, and you know their website is ACME.com, but did you know that they have
  a non-profit arm at ACME.org, and that there is a European branch at ACME.eu
  or that their development team runs an extranet at ACME.net and that vendors
  login from vendor.acme.net while the development team logs in at dev.acme.net?

  Let's find new domains using brute forcing. First we should look for what is
  available, then install, load, and run the selected module. Follow along the
  command prompts below. Due to the large number of TLDs this can take a long
  time - if you get tired of waiting press CTRL + C to interrupt the process -
  it will still save the results in the database:

  **Next Steps**

  Below are some suggestions for further steps in the reconnaissance phase:
  * Resolve IP addresses.
  * Run port scan data harvesting modules (try recon/hosts-ports/binaryedge using the BinaryEdge API).
  * Run vulnerability harvesting modules.
  * Run contact harvesting modules.
  * Mangle contacts into email addresses.
  * Run modules that convert email addresses into full contacts.
  * Run credential harvesting modules.
  Many useful modules require the usage of a 3rd party service's API key.

  As you can see recon-ng is very powerful when used efficiently with and
  understanding of the actions made available by the different modules. By
  spending time reading through the module descriptions (```marketplace info
  <modulename>```), utilising the tool, and understanding various API services,
  you can master the usage of this tool for your reconnaissance work.

  **Reporting**
  * Export data for analysis or presentation:
  ```
  [recon-ng][websitename] > marketplace install reporting/csv
  [recon-ng][websitename] > modules load reporting/csv
  [recon-ng][websitename][csv] |
  [recon-ng][websitename][csv] > set TABLE Domains
  TABLE => Domains
  [recon-ng][websitename][csv] > set FILENAME
  /home/computer/.recon-ng/workspaces/websitename/Domains.csv
  FILENAME => /home/computer/.recon-ng/workspaces/websitename/Domains.csv
  [recon-ng][websitename][csv] > run
  [*] 5 records added to
  '/home/computer/.recon-ng/workspaces/websitename/Domains.csv'.
  ```

  **Creating API Keys**

  To use modules requiring an API key you will need to sign up for an API key
  from the specified service. These keys may offer free or paid plans, and
  functionality may be limited on free plans.

  To add a key after you have obtained one (see below), get the recon-ng name
  for the key by typing ```keys list``` which will tell you the name of keys
  needed for the modules you have already installed. With your new API key in
  hand, add them with ```keys add <apiname> <apikey>```, for instance ```keys
  add bing_api a7b92c729e829f8a7cba4bc```.

  ###### Variant: Foca Analyzer

  Requirements:

  - FOCA executable
  - Windows Environment (Virtualized)
  - .NET Framework

  **Installing FOCA analyzer**

  - Download from [FOCA
  website](https://www.elevenpaths.com/labstools/foca/index.html#)
  - Install [.NET Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/linux)
  - Extract FOCA zip file into a folder
  - To launch, go to ```foca pro``` then```bin``` and select FOCA application

  **Features & Functionality**

  FOCA scanner has tons of great features from web searches and DNS searches as
  examples. To know more of functionalities, visit [FOCA's
  website](https://www.elevenpaths.com/labstools/foca/index.html)

  **Creating Your first Project:**

  To create a project in FOCA, click ```Project``` on the tab menu, and select
  ```New Project```

  There are few items to fill in FOCA:

  - **Project name:** Name of your project
  - **Domain website:** the Website of your target
  - **Alternative domains:** for sub-domains, and other domains that your target
  own
  - **Folder where to save documents:** Select any folder or create a folder for
  your FOCA results
  - **Project date:** Date of your project (automatically filled up)
  - **Project notes:** Any notes that you have for this particular project

  After completing the forms, select the button ```Create```

  **Scan and Search:**

  After saving your project, it will bring you to the main window. On the upper
  right hand corner of your screen, you will see the two settings:

  - **Search Engines:** search engines you wanted to use (*Google, Bing,
  Exalead*)
  - **Extensions:** Extension refers to file extensions (*doc, docx, xls, xlsx
  etc*) By selecting an extension, it will be included in the scan/search.

  Click the ```Search All``` buttong below the ```Extension``` options to start
  scan.

  Note: FOCA will give you a warning regarding the IP address of the target and
  it’s netrange owner. This will be added to the alternative domain.

  **Analyzing Public Documents:**

  The results of FOCA depends on the files/documents uploaded to the website
  that are "publicly available". There are situations, where an organization may
  not have any publicly available documents. If that is the case, move next to
  the Maltego assessment activity.

  However, if your scan generates files/documents scanned, you can may analyzing
  and extract metadata from the identified files/documents.

  **Downloading Files:**

  After when the search/scan has completed, right-click on any file, (NOTE: you
  can start downloading files one-by-one, or all at once by using SHIFT+SELECT.
  you can only extract metadata of files that are already downloaded). If the
  target website contains a lot of files and documents available, you may want
  to download all the files all at once.

  **Extracting Metadata:**

  After selecting a file/s that is/are downloaded, you may ```right-click``` and
  select ```Download Metadata```
  You may start analyzing the files one-by-one of all at once. To do this,
  first, download all documents. Then, right-click, select ```Extract all
  Metadata```. After Extracting your metadatas you can now ```right-click```
  again, and select: ```analzye metadata```. (There’s a green button that will
  appear once a file has been downloaded and analyzed. It will show download
  progress bars for each individual files and the time it takes time to
  download)

  **Analyzing Reports and Findings**

  After downloading documents and extracting metadata, you may view the results
  on the left side pane of your FOCA.
  On the left pane, you will see the following options:
  - Network
  - Domains
  - Roles
  - Vulnerabilities
  - Metadata
  Under ```Metadata``` you will have two sub-menus, ```Documents``` and
  ```Metadata Summary```. The ```Documents```, option displays scraped metadata
  per document/file. However, on ```Metadata Summary``` option, you will have
  the following options:
  - User
  - Folders
  - Printers
  - Software
  - Emails
  - Operating Systems
  - Passwords
  - Servers
  These information can then be added to your records and be used for other
  attack surface such as social engineering attacks.

  ###### Variant: Maltego

  **What is Maltego?**

  According to the Maltego's official website, they define maltego as:
  "An interactive data mining tool that renders directed graphs for link
  analysis. The tool is used in online investigations for finding relationships
  between pieces of information from various sources located on the Internet.

  Maltego uses the idea of transforms to automate the process of querying
  different data sources. This information is then displayed on a node based
  graph suited for performing link analysis."

  Maltego has may different uses:
  - Information Gathering and Data Mining
      - Email addresses, Aliases, domain names, DNS records, IP addresses
      - Document and files
      - Affiliations
  - Investigation and Threat Intelligence
      - Investigating targeted attacks
      - Analyzing malicious files
  These are just some of the ways you can use Maltego. However with this guide,
  we will use Maltego for information gathering and data mining. The information
  we will find will later on be used in the following stages of
  audit/vulnerability assessment/penetration testing.

  Maltego also has different versions:
  - Maltego XL
  - Maltego Classic
  - Maltego CE (Community Edition)
  For this exercise, we will be using the Maltego CE version.

  **Registration**

  Maltego is available in the latest release of Kali Linux. (See
  [here](https://www.kali.org/kali-linux-releases))
  NOTE: To run Maltego, you first need to have an account. To register, click
  [here](https://www.paterva.com/web7/community/community.php). Consider
  carefully the operational security implications of this requirement, in
  particular if you use one account for multiple different audits.

  **Getting Started:**

  Before we proceed with this guide, let us first take a look on Maltego's 3
  main important concept.
  - Entity
    According to Maltego, "Entity is represented as a node on a graph and can be anything such as a DNS Name, Person, Phone number, etc. The Maltego client comes with about 20 entities targeted for use in online investigations, but you can also make your own custom ones."
  - Transform
    Tranforms is defined as "a piece of code that takes one entity to another. It does this by querying a data source and returning the results as new entities on your graph. The data sources are places like DNS servers, search engines, social networks, WHOIS information, etc."
  - Machines
    In Maltego, a machine can "a chain multiple transforms together to automate common/tedious tasks."
  **Running Maltego for the first time**

  To initialize Maltego, on your Kali Linux, click ```Applications``` > ```01 -
  Information Gathering``` > ```Maltego```. This will bring you to the "Home"
  screen of the Maltego application and will show you a list of available
  Transforms. Transforms are simply a set of activities that you can run against
  a specific target. We'll learn more of transforms in the following topics.

  **Creating a New Graph**

  To create a new graph where we can put our first task, click the Maltego icon
  on the upper left corner of your window, and click *New*. This will now open a
  blank screen, with the tab entitled *New Graph*.

  **Selecting Pallete Entity**

  Pallete is located on the left pane side called "Entity Pallete". This
  contains all the Entity that you can use depending on the activity that you
  are going to perform. For our exercise, look for the ```Domain``` entity
  pallete. Once you find it, drag it and drop it to the blank graph to the
  right. Now you have an entity on your graph. Try to double click the
  ```domain``` entity to rename it to your target (for this example, we can use
  ```paterva.com```)

  **Choosing Transforms**

  Once you have edited your entity, you can ```right-click``` to open the ```Run
  Transform(s)``` option. You can see here all the available transforms you can
  use. (Depending on the transforms that you have installed)

  For this exercise, click the ```+``` on the left side of ```PATERVA CTAS
  CE```. This will give use 4 transforms:
  - DNS from Domain
  - Domain owner detail
  - Email addresses from Domain
  - Files and Documents from Domain
  You can run each of this transforms individually, or you can click the
  ```>>``` icon to run ```All Transforms```.

  Once you click it, all Transforms will run on the ```paterva.com``` domain.
  This graph result will include:
  - Sub-domains
  - Email addresses
  - Files and documents
  - IP addresses
  - Geolocation
  - Domain registrants
  - Telephone numbers
