summary: |
  The auditor checks staff devices for updated systems and software, anti-virus
  and other security capabilities, and identifies software runing on computers
  and its current version.  The auditor checks for known vulnerabilities to any
  out of date software.

  This is used to develop a report component exposing how out-of-date software
  can lead to large vulnerabilities.
overview: |
  * You can do this as a focused activity where staff walk you through a usual
  "day in their life" showing you what devices they use, how they use them, and
  what data they have to interact with to conduct their work; or this can be
  integrated with other formal and informal activities/interactions where you
  ask staff questions on their usage of technology and remote services
materials_needed: ''
considerations: |
  * Communicate with the staff members the level of confidentiality you are
  treating discussions around their device and technology usage with - i.e.
  explain what incident response triggers you have agreed upon with the
  organization, and that anything not triggering that is to be only reported in
  aggregate.

  * If using screen sharing, "lock" the room and make sure the user knows to
  end the call if anyone unexpected joins the room (unlikely) or if they
  accidentally show private or confidential data
walk_through: |
  As you work with staff members (this pairs well with the device checklist
  activity), also interview them about the other devices they use, and how they
  connect to work services - email/webmail, intra/extranet tools, Constituent
  Relationship Management (CRM) tools like CiviCRM or Salesforce, financial
  tracking tools, and website management tools.

  This can also be done remotely. Ask to have the staff member use a
  screensharing tool (meet.jit.si offers easy-to-use, browser based
  options) so that you can watch how they interact with their computer and what
  applications are active in the background.

recommendations: |
  **If Unsupported Operating System - Upgrade to Recent Version**

  Popular operating systems like Windows 7 are, sadly, no longer receiving
  security updates. Upgrade to the latest version keeping in mind the system
  requirements of the version selected. For Windows, review the [Windows
  lifecycle fact
  sheet](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet)
  for upcoming "EOLs" (End of Life). Apple does not publish EOL schedules, but
  historically releases security updates for their current and two prior
  releases.

  While "pirated" operating systems and software are extremely common
  (especially for Windows) they often leave much to be desired in terms of
  security.  If the OS or Software is not receiving regular updates from the
  software creator, it is extremely vulnerable to thousands of potential
  attacks. Switch to licensed software or recommended Free Open Source Software

  **If Pirated Software - Move to Licensed Software Systems**

  While "pirated" operating systems and software are extremely common
  (especially for Windows) they often leave much to be desired in terms of
  security.  If the OS or Software is not receiving regular updates from the
  software creator, it is extremely vulnerable to thousands of potential
  attacks. Switch to licensed software or recommended Free Open Source Software

  **If Outdated - Update Operating Systems and Other Software**

  Operating Systems and Softwares of all varieties - Windows, Mac, Linux, and
  others, are constantly being updated.  These updates often fix bugs, but they
  also protect the system from newly discovered vulnerabilities.  It can seem
  difficult to keep updating constantly, but this is very important to protect
  even non-sensitive systems.

  **If No Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware Scanner - Install Anti-Virus and
  Anti-Maware Scanner**

  An Anti-virus and Anti-malware offer some minimal protection to the system and
  therefore is important to have them installed. Windows and macOS already offer
  fantastic built-in anti-malware capabilities. They should be sufficient for
  most cases.

  **If Outdated Anti-Virus - Update Anti-Virus**

  Most AV tools automatically update, but this can sometimes get out of sync, or
  if the AV was a pre-installed trial system, it will stop updating after its
  trial period.  An out of date anti-virus is worthless. Therefore ensure that
  continuous udpdating of AV is done.

  **If Unencrypted Drive  - Encrypt Hard Drives**

  When possible, built-in drive encryption (Filevault on macOS, BitLockeron
  Windows, and LUKS on Linux) tend to offer the most seamless, user-friendly
  experiences. VeraCrypt offers free cross-platform drive encryption and cna
  also create encrypted drives which can be shared across platforms.

  **If Inactive firewall - Activate both personal and server firewall (If
  present)**

  Again, where present, use built-in firewalls and configure them for both
  office and public network options. Testing to ensure systems can still perform
  expected office natworking (file sharing, printing, etc.) is essential unless
  alternatives are created.
