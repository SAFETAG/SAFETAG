summary: |
  The auditor interviews the staff about their practices, personal devices,
  software and other security capabilities that they use outside of work. The
  auditor checks for known vulnerabilities to any out of date software and
  identifies risks in the practices and behaviors.

  This is used to develop a report component exposing how practices outside of
  their work can affect their personal security and that of the organization.
overview: |
  * Integrated with other activities/interactions, interview staff on their
  usage of technology and remote services outside of standard working hours
  and standard working locations
  * Understand that, in some cases, non-work conversations, social media
  activity or activities could also present a security risk. It's worth
  discussing how the organization's risk profile can affect non-work activities

materials_needed: ''
considerations: |
  * Communicate with the staff members the level of confidentiality you are
  treating discussions around their device and technology usage with - i.e.
  explain what incident response triggers you have agreed upon with the
  organization, and that anything not triggering that is to be only reported in
  aggregate.

  * If using screen sharing, "lock" the virtual room or make sure the user knows
 to end the call if anyone unexpected joins the room (unlikely)
walk_through: |
  As you work with staff members (this pairs well with the device checklist
  activity and a day in the life), also interview them about the other devices
  they use, and how they connect to work or personal services - email/webmail,
  intra/extranet tools, Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) tools like
  CiviCRM or Salesforce, financial tracking tools, social media, and website
  management tools.

  This can also be done remotely. Ask to have the staff member use a
  screensharing tool (meet.jit.si or appear.in offer easy-to-use, browser based
  options) so that you can watch how they interact with their computer and what
  applications are active in the background.

  **Personal Practices**

  * Office/home location, and if there are any security concerns about this
  * Transportation means
  * Personal travel, especially to high-risk locations
  * Close friends and family members' activities: is it possible that some of them will
  need to adopt additional security practices as a result of their relationship with you?
  For example, they might not be able to safely pursue certain types of activism, work on
  some projects, or travel to some places if they are publicly or privately associated
  with you.
  * Physical security

recommendations: |
  **Multi Factor Authentication**

  When possible, enable multi factor authentication on work accounts (email,
  social media, website administration, etc). Specially if the accounts are
  being accessed with personal devices.
