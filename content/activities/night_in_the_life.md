summary: >

  The auditor interviews the staff about their practices, personal devices,
  software and other security capabilities that they use outside of work. The
  auditor checks for known vulnerabilities to any out of date software and
  identifies risks in the practices and behaviors.


  This is used to develop a report component exposing how practices outside of
  their work can affect their personal security and that of the organization.
overview: >

  * Integrated with other activities/interactions, interview staff on their
  usage of technology and remote services outside of work
materials_needed: ''
considerations: >

  * Communicate with the staff members the level of confidentiality you are
  treating discussions around their device and technology usage with - i.e.
  explain what incident response triggers you have agreed upon with the
  organization, and that anything not triggering that is to be only reported in
  aggregate.


  * If using screen sharing, use a service with transport security and "lock"
  the room or make sure the user knows to end the call if anyone unexpected
  joins the room (unlikely)
walk_through: >

  As you work with staff members (this pairs well with the device checklist
  activity and a day in the life), also interview them about the other devices
  they use, and how they connect to work or personal services - email/webmail,
  intra/extranet tools, Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) tools like
  CiviCRM or Salesforce, financial tracking tools, social media, and website
  management tools.


  This can also be done remotely. Ask to have the staff member use a
  screensharing tool (meet.jit.si or appear.in offer easy-to-use, browser based
  options) so that you can watch how they interact with their computer and what
  applications are active in the background.
