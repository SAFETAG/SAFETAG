summary: |
  It can be valuable to to listen to broadcast wireless traffic at  the physical
  office location, even before knowing anything about the organization's network
  itself. This outside, passive information gathering can reveal a surprising
  amount of data on not only what devices are connecting to which networks, but
  also what type of devices they are (based on their unique MAC addresses), and
  what other networks those devices have historically connected to. These probes
  can reveal personal, organizational, locational, and device information that,
  taken in context, can be dangerous or lead to other vulnerabilities.
overview: |
  Each wireless device maintains a "memory" of what networks it has successfully
  connected to. When it is connecting to a network, it sends out "probes" to all
  of the networks it has in this memory. It is important to note that this data
  gets broadcast widely, and can be collected without any network access, only
  proximity to the device.

  These network probes can often contain names (especially from mobile phone
  tethers), organizational affiliations, device manufacturers, and a mixture of
  other potentially valuable data (home network names, recent airports/travel
  locations, cafés and conference networks). If there are many networks in the
  office's vicinity, this activity can also help identify the specific office
  network (if there is any doubt). In many cases, an organization may not want
  the name of their wireless network to be associated with their organization,
  but it may be revealed by this additional meta-data.

  Beacons can "de-anonymize" an obfuscated network name as well as provide rich
  content for social engineering attacks. This provides an only-lightly-invasive
  introduction to discuss the trackability of devices, particularly mobiles and
  laptops.

  * Scan for wireless networks nearby, identify (and confirm) the office
  network(s).
  * Monitor traffic of that network and capture potentially sensitive metadata
  (wireless security settings, beacons, and MAC addresses).
  * Research likely device hardware using MAC addresses.
  * Do the staff devices leak sensitive metadata?
  * What can be determined about the organization based on broadcast wireless
  data?
materials_needed: |
  * Wifi card (and drivers) that can be set to monitor mode.
considerations: |
  * Despite this exercise covering only broadcast data, check the local laws
  which might cover this process before conducting it.
  * Consider how it looks to third parties as you are scanning a network,
  especially from outside an office.
  * Confirm that all devices you are accessing/scanning belong to the
  organization.
  * Delete all devices from your scan that do not belong to the organization.
  * Study outputs for any obviously embarrassing personal information
  (especially network beacon records) before sharing.
walk_through: |
  ###### Step 1: Monitor Mode

  You should disconnect from any wifi network you may be connected to to capture the widest amount of data.

  Switch your wireless adapter to monitor mode**

  ```$ airmon-ng start <interface>```

  You may need to stop your network manager system to prevent it from interfering. Running

  ```$ airmon-ng check```

  to list anything that is causing problems, and

  ```$ airmon-ng check kill```

  to try and stop them automatically, and running stop network-manager && stop avahi-daemon may keep them from re-starting automatically.


  ###### Step 2: Listen for wifi probes.

  Run airodump-ng on the monitor mode interface (usually mon0). This listens to wifi beacons and you can begin analyzing who is on what network, and see historical networks.

  ```airodump-ng -w filename mon0```

  This scans all networks and channels, collecting broadcast network information. Note that, despite its broadcast nature, this is privacy invasive and can be considered illegal: http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/09/16/google_street_view_wi_fi_snooping_case_good_news_and_bad_news.html . You can restict this to a specific channel or base station ID (BSSID) with -c and --bssid:

  ```airodump-ng -c 1 --bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55 -w filename mon0```


  ###### Step 3: de-auth (optional)

  Send de-authentication packets to force clients to reconnect and send out additional probes. Take note that by its very nature, de-authentication causes annoying interruptions to wifi traffic. **This breaks connections, drops VoIP calls, and can make the wireless network temporarily unusable -- Make sure to check with staff before going through this** (to make sure no one is doing a live webcast or on an important VOIP call, and to expect some network instability).

  ```
  $ aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 00:11:22:33:44:55 -c AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF mon0

   15:54:48  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: 00:11:22:33:44:55) on channel 1
   15:54:49  Sending 64 directed DeAuth. STMAC: [AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF] [ 5| 3 ACKs]
  ```

  This command de-authenticates one targeted user with one attempted deauth packet.  "-0 10" would try 10 times (potentially disconnecting the user multiple times!). With permission, you can also target all users on a network by leaving out the "-c ..." flag.

  There are scripts, like wifijammer, which use this same approach to jam *all* wifi connections in range of the attacking computer, so check against the documentation at http://www.aircrack-ng.org and act responsibly to protect yourself and the organization.

  ###### Step 4: MAC Address Research

  The first three hex numbers of each MAC address designate the vendor, which can reveal useful information in matching MAC addresses to devices. The MAC address is a unique identifier, so never post or search using the full address.  Note that increasingly, devices are using MAC address randomization, but if it implemented, it often is poorly implemented against even minimally determined adversaries, as per this [2017 research study](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/10/mac_address_randomization/).

  To compare found MAC addresses to the bendor database offline you can download the full vendor database from [IEEE](https://regauth.standards.ieee.org/standards-ra-web/pub/view.html#registries) or use the [Wireshark list](
  https://code.wireshark.org/review/gitweb?p=wireshark.git;a=blob_plain;f=manuf)


  ###### Step 4: Ongoing Monitoring

  The longer you leave this running (particularly when staff are first entering the office or returning after lunch/meetings), the better sense of what devices are connected to the network you will get.

  Watch what probes the various devices are sending out (especially when they are deauthenticated, as above). You will see each computer on the network, as identified by their mac addresses, broadcast information about previous networks to which they have connected.

  ```

recommendations: |
  For most devices, deleting networks from the “saved” network list will stop
  them from being probed. Obviously, this can be an annoyance for networks you
  regularly connect to, so renaming these networks to non-revealing names would
  help, as would creating non-name-associated “guest” networks for colleagues
  connecting to your home network.

  On iPhones and iPads, it is not possible to selectively remove historical
  networks unless you are currently in range of that network. It is however
  possible to remove all history: go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset
  Network Settings . When you take this step, it is worth going through this
  reset multiple times – approximately once per year of device ownership, as the
  first reset appears to only remove recently-connected networks, and older
  networks will be broadcast.

  Organizations may want to choose innocent or generic network names, and/or not
  broadcast network names. It is worth noting that devices seeking out hidden
  networks will "beacon" for the actual network name, so this has extremely
  limited security use and must be combined with other protective measures. See
  this [Acrylic blog
  post](https://www.acrylicwifi.com/en/blog/hidden-ssid-wifi-how-to-know-name-of-network-without-ssid/)
  for further details.

  It is worth noting that wifi access points are also tracked to assist in
  location services, and as such the location of a wireless network can be
  learned from its name or the MAC address of the access point.
  [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) is a community-managed database for such
  information, but both Google and Microsoft, and likely many others, also track
  this locational information, so the opt-out information below is only
  minimally useful.
