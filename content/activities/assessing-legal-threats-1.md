summary: This activity was built to assist civil society organizations (CSOs) in
  safeguarding institutional integrity and resilience by preventing legal
  uncertainty. It is based on organizational guiding questions that help better
  frame and assess administrative or legal liability directly or indirectly
  derived from their work. The methodology is based on historical experiences
  that CSOs have faced, specific assessments for civil society, and judicial
  precedents from various contexts. Thus, its objective is to contribute to a
  culture of constant legal evaluation from within the organizations and with
  legal professionals.
short_summary: " "
overview: >-
  By nature, the power asymmetries that civil society organizations challenge
  bring reactions that can come in the form of physical, digital, or
  institutional threats. Within all those aspects, legal harassment often
  appears, threatening the group’s stability. This activity aims to contribute
  to legal assessments during the whole life-cycle of civil society work, from
  planning to evaluating its results and, to avoid and mitigate legal threats
  posed by those in power. 


  The outputs of this activity are:


  * A diagnosis of existing legal vulnerabilities and threats faced by the organization.

  * A map of foreseeable legal risks based on vulnerabilities and potentialities of the organization.

  * The establishment of a comprehensive response and timely plan in case of incidents involving legal threats to the organization.

  * The development of a collective and internal legal security assessment.
Considerations`: >-
  Given each country has its legal framework and context, conducting a legal
  assessment in different jurisdictions will require very different workflows
  and as a result, will give very different outcomes. With this in mind, the
  activity proposes general aspects and questions related to legal security to
  be explored in light of the specific context present in each
  jurisdiction/country.


  * Besides the legal framework in each jurisdiction, another factor to consider is the status of the rule of law. For instance, in some countries, regardless of the legitimate nature of CSOs and activism in general, the law is enforced discretionarily to criminalize and persecute these activities. This might result in higher levels of uncertainty but will make visible other aspects of security that should be addressed the same. Conducting more expanded threat assessment exercises would complement and help kickstart this activity.

  * For accuracy, this activity requires the assistance from a lawyer expert in the local jurisdiction to advise, especially in the legal landscape, key regulations, state of the rule of law, and enforcement related to the operations of CSOs.

  * Keep in mind that the legal field covers a wide range of aspects: criminal law, taxes, labor, etc. So, try to cover as many of them as possible.

  * Scenarios including litigation against civil society individuals and organizations also encompass sensitive political contexts, not only in less democratic regimes and dictatorships but also in “established democracies”. Political figures can be put on the spotlight because of civil society investigations, which can trigger a legal reaction of authorities for political reasons. As a result, being prepared for these situations is also part of risk assessments, including those of a legal nature. So, there is no “fault” or irresponsibility if a CSO is being sued because of its work, even though it is important to cultivate organizational awareness.

  * The product of this activity, including communications with the legal professional, will contain sensitive information that can put the organization at risk if accessed by adversaries. With this in mind, these outcomes must be sufficiently secured by digital controls (such as encryption, secure passwords, and authentication) and have their access restricted to authorized personnel only. 

  * Finally, proper legal advising, specific to each case and context, is essential. As a result, although a legal risk assessment culture has to be built within a CSO, seeking advice and legal consultation with a law professional is the basic response and expected institutional reaction when facing a legal threat. Meanwhile, CSOs can better organize themselves to give law professionals the proper informational resources.

  * Depending on the kind of work the auditor or the organization usually does, and the level of experience they have from previous experiences with legal threats and strategies, it might be possible that any of them feel the capacity to conduct parts of this activity on their own. In that case, keep in mind that many components of the regulatory framework and/or its enforcement might have changed from previous experiences, so proceed at your own risk. If possible, refer to a professional lawyer with knowledge of the different aspects covered in this activity.
walk_through: >-
  1. It is necessary to have an inventory of documentation concerning the
  questions below, updated and at hand to assist a legal professional.
  Designating one person or a small team to be responsible for this can make the
  procedure more structured and part of routine processes.

  2. The documentation may include not only the essential bureaucratic material, such as statutory documents but also the initial risk assessments made by the CSO, establishing avoidable and inherent risks to the organization based on the questions below. Conversations and interviews with other partner CSOs might be helpful to give more input to this internal job, making it more complete.

  3. Then, the assistance of a legal professional or legal firm will be fundamental. The CSO will be able to comprehensively understand their legal status according to their unique jurisdiction. The duty of the legal professional is to help the organization walk through the country's legal framework, enhancing the risk assessment with legal certainty. If that is the situation, the responsible person or team within the CSO will be responsible for updating the documentation regarding the assessment and be the contact point with the legal professional. Some guiding questions for this stage are:

     1. **Bureaucracy**

        1. Is the organization formally constituted and registered, with the legal requirements in place, such as an updated statute and eventual fees and taxes duly paid?
        2. About the work conditions within the organization, does the staff have their labor rights fully guaranteed (time-off and respect for weekly working hours, and signed contract, for example)?
        3. Does the organization have an appointed DPO (Data Protection Officer)? (In case the jurisdiction requires it).
        4. Are there any extra aspects that might require permits or paid fees according to the local law (like health permits, property taxes, or activity authorizations)?
     2. **Institutional/organizational**

        1. Does the organization have a legal team? Or does the organization have institutional relationships with legal professionals focused on counseling civil society (before, during, or after a given activity or milestone)?
        2. Concerning the management of digital material (the whole set of digitized files and servers), could the leak of such material lead to damage to the honor/reputation or the propriety of someone or something (an institution, for example)?
        3. Does the organization disclose the name and source of its funding? If so, how does it happen (for example, in a specific area of the institutional website or on an annual report)? Is this disclosure necessary, or might it bring issues if done?
     3. **Socio-political**

        1. In the past year, did your organization experience any of the following: government surveillance, vandalism in its premises, judicial or administrative process or harassment, targeted cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, or negative media reports?
        2. According to the criminal law legal framework of the country, does the organization have or once have had some activity (being a one-time action or a project, for example) that could be labeled or typified as a crime?
        3. Within the national legal framework (covering the Federal Constitution and other laws), does the organization consider the protection of CSOs work coherent and reasonable, such as their freedom of assembly and peaceful manifestation?
        4. In manifestations and protests, does the organization record its activities (by audio or video), or are usually accompanied by individuals who do that, such as journalists? 
  4. After consultation with a legal professional, it is important for all the staff of the CSO to be aware of the rules and guidelines. That can be done through an email memorandum or a personal or virtual meeting, but all the staff must be aligned and aware of the work being done.

  5. The natural product of the legal risk assessment may be a **“must-read” document with legal guidelines** for new personnel affiliated with the organization. That will keep the staff updated from the beginning, avoiding “re-work” and actual legal risks.

  6. It is ideal to revisit the guidelines at least once a year. This task can be done by the person or team responsible for it, counting on the eventual inputs of others as well, but together with a legal professional. The objective here is to adapt and re-evaluate the risk assessment according to new political and legal landscapes that are in constant change. Making it an organic part of the administrative work is central to the institutional development of the organization and accomplishment of the organization’s mission.   

  7. The security procedures to store and manage the information related to the assessment can be revised annually together with the guidelines by the responsible person or team.
