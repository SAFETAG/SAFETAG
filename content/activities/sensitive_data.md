summary: >
  Data and meta-data about an organization and its staff is incredibly difficult
  to keep track of over time, as people or projects use cloud services like
  Dropbox or Google Drive for some activities, a shared server for others, and a
  mix of work and personal devices (laptops, phones, tablets...).


  This is natural, but it is important to keep track of where your organization's data lives and who can access it.
short_summary: Assessment of data and metadata managed by the organization with
  a security perspective
overview: >
  * With staff input, post up popular places where data is kept (laptops, email,
  shared drives...)

  * Using stickies, gather from the staff what data is kept in what locations - duplicating notes when needed

  * Rank data by sensitivity

  * Discuss the impact of one of the devices where data is stored being lost - are there backups?

  * Discuss the impact of a device being exposed / taken by an adversary

  * Identify who has access (physical access, login access, and permissions), and who needs to have access to get the organizations work completed.
materials_needed: >
  * Stickies and markers for activities

  * Flipchart paper

  * One larger sheet of paper taped to wall in landscape orientation, with or without prepared titles. The vertical access is for Sensitivity (High / Medium / Low), and the horizontal access will be by where data is stored and will evolve throughout the exercise.  For an example with prepared headings, see the **sample matrix** in the walkthrough section below.  The Sensitivity axis is optional in the original exercise, but critical for this one. It can be added after the initial round of brainstorming however to streamline the flow.

  **Process**

  Explain to participants that we're going to conduct an information mapping
  activity to get a sense of where our important information actually is.


  Start by listing the different places where our information is stored,
  according to participants. If no suggestions are forthcoming, we can prompt
  participants with the obvious stuff:


  * Computer hard drives

  * USB flash drives

  * External hard drives

  * Cellphones

  * CDs & DVDs (and BDs)

  * Our email inbox

  * The Cloud: Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive, etc

  * Physical copies (or “hard copies”) in the office

  * Multimedia: Video tapes, audio recordings, photographs, etc.


  Use large stickies to place these as column headers on a wall.  More will
  come up later in the course of the exercise.


  Elicit from participants what type of information or data they have in each
  of these places. For example:


  * Email

  * Contact details, such as a member database

  * Reports/research

  * Funder information / contracts

  * Accounts/spreadsheets

  * Videos

  * Images

  * Private messages on Facebook, etc.


  To encourage participant interaction, write one example on a sticky and
  place it in the appropriate box in the matrix. Then, ask whether there is
  another copy of this data somewhere. If there is, you can use another sticky
  and put it wherever they keep the duplicate.


  *TIP:* Place Computers, Phones, and Email next to each other, so you won't
  have to create duplicates for everything \"stored\" in email (and therefore on
  laptops and phones)


  Introduce a new vertical axis representing sensitivity. The higher on the
  chart, the more sensitive the data.  Ask the participants to rank data.


  For a large group, divide the group into smaller teams for the next steps
  (it helps if there are relatively clear thematic distinctions within the
  group, such as nationality, type of work, area of interest, etc.)


  Provide stickies to the group(s).  Have the group(s) brainstorm about all of
  the data they work with, focusing on the most important data first.


  Participants should write ONE type per sticky, and create duplicates if the
  data is stored in multiple locations.


  For a small group, this can be done as a \"live\" brainstorm.  For larger
  groups that have been subdivided, have each group finish listing out their
  most important data and then have each group place the stickies on the
  matrix.  Invite discussions around the sensitivity of the data.


  An example may look something like this:


  ![Level Up Backup Matrix Example with a matrix filled in with stickies
  representing specific types of data stored in different locations (e.g. email,
  shared drive, backups)](/img/activity_sensitive-data_backup-matrix-example.png
  \"Example of a filled in matrix\")


  Explain that this gives us an idea of where our data is. Elicit whether or
  not this is all the data we generate? Of course it isn't: It's only a small
  percentage.


  The LevelUp lesson uses this primarily to discuss the importance of backups,
  and this is a valuable point to make.


  Call out the information that they are keeping on their computer's hard
  drive (which will usually be the fullest one). Elicit some of the things that
  can cause a computer to stop working. Maybe take a show of hands: Who has had
  this happen to them?


  * Virus or malware attack destroyed a computer or some data

  * Stolen computer, confiscated computer

  * Infrastructural problems, like a power failure broke a computer

  * Inexplicably bricked computer, etc.


  For SAFETAG, we focus on the \"Sensitive data in the wrong hands\"
  section.  Based on the clustering of sensitive data along the vertical access,
  choose a column that has an unsual amount of sensitive data (email or
  computers, usually).


  Remove the stickies from the column but keep them in your hand and read
  them. Now I have this information. What can I do with it? And what are you
  left with?  Is anyone at risk - yourselves? partners?  If this were published
  on the Internet, what would happen?\n"
considerations: >
  * Some of the stickies generated in this activity may provide sensitive data,
  dispose of them responsibly.

  * If you take photos for reporting needs, save the image files in a secure, encrypted container.
recommendations: >
  Laptops, workstations, servers, external hard drives, and backup systems
  should be configured to use some form of hard drive encryption.

  * Windows systems use either [Bitlocker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/bitlocker/) or [Windows Device Encryption](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-encryption-in-windows-cf7e2b6f-3e70-4882-9532-18633605b7df)

  * All modern macOS systems (those which currently receive software updates) have their drives encrypted by default.

  * VeraCrypt is a cross-platform solution that is open source and free of charge, and can work on Mac, Windows, and Linux machines as well.

  All three solutions provide a way to encrypt data on internal drives as well as external hard drives, and flash drives. For more information on encryption materials, check out the [SaferJourno guide](https://saferjourno.org/chapter-5/#training-digital-security-for-the-first-time) on the topic.
