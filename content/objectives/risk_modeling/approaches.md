* FACILITATED: One on One interviews with staff to supplement other group activities.
* FACILITATED: A classic group [Risk Assessment Activity](http://frontlinedefenders.org/files/workbook_eng.pdf#page=9).

Carry out activities that allow you to do the following:

  * Identify and map critical organizational *processes*.
  * Identify *threats* to those processes.
  * Identify the *impact* to the organization if those threats occur.
    * Rank the severity of the impacts identified.
  * Identify *adversaries* (people or groups) who may attempt to carry out threats and their capabilities.

Note that the order which you identify each component will vary depending upon what the host participants want to focus on first.

Throughout the activities:

  * Identify existing in/formal security practices that the participants use to address risks.

After the activities are complete the auditor has tasks that build upon the outputs of the activities. These can be completed offsite.

  * Create a risk matrix placing *impacts* against a range of likelihood.
  * Clean up critical process maps for use in reporting.
  * Create a list of all services or assets that were identified during the activity that were not already known by the auditor.
