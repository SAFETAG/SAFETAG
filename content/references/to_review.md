Risk Management Expense Portfolio Tool
http://www.eisf.eu/resources/item/?d=7485
It is presented as the culmination of input from the EISF members to design a tool that clarifies the estimation and recording of a program's safety and/or security costs. The outputs can then be clearly presented to donors to demonstrate a clear evidence-base for risk line items within budgets.


The Cost of Security Risk Management for NGOs
http://www.eisf.eu/resources/item/?d=7488
EISF's Report explores the costs related to safety and security management for aid programmes. It aims to assist all aid practitioners to determine their risk management expenditure more accurately, and demonstrate an evidence-based approach when presenting this information to donors.
