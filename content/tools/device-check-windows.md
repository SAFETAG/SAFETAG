  **Windows XP**

  If user is still operating on windows XP, recommendation is to upgrade to

  If there is an organizationally critical system relying on Windows XP,
  removing it from the network and carefully managing data exchange with it may
  provide a bridge solution until a replacement process can be funded and rolled
  out.
