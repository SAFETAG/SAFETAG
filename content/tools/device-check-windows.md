  **Older versions of Windows**

  Older Windows versions, such as XP, 7, and 8, are out of date and no
  longer receive security updates. This makes them vulnerable to a wide
  range of malware and other attacks.
  If an organizationally critical system is running one of those older versions,
  remove it from the network and carefully manage data exchange with it. Then,
  build a plan to replace it with a more up to date version.
