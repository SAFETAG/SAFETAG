  **Windows XP**


  If user is still operating on windows XP, recommendation is to upgrade to
  later windows. Windows XP is no longer supported and is not receiving security
  updates: https://www.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/xp/end-of-xp-support.aspx


  If there is an organizationally critical system relying on Windows XP,
  removing it from the network and carefully managing data exchange with it may
  provide a bridge solution until a replacement process can be funded and rolled
  out.
