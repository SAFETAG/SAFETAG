title: Follow Up & Ongoing Support
position: 190
method_icon: "/img/follow_up_icon.png"
summary: |
  This component supports a continued relationship with the host organisation after the assessment report has been presented, allowing time for the organization to digest findings, come back for clarifications, and (if possible) receive additional support while they work to implement the auditor's recommendations or face new and emerging challenges. The auditor may also need to evaluate the success of the process.

guiding_questions: |
  * What are the barriers the organization faced in implementing the recommended risk mitigation plan?
  * Are there new resources that the auditor can provide to supplement the original audit?
  * What can you do to make your follow up perceived as additional support instead of as an evaluation of their success?
  * Is the organization making self-directed technology decisions to address the recommendations and vulnerabilities found? If not, will you have the capacity to support new software or hardware that you recommendeded or implemented while providing support?

outputs: |
  * Host organization embarks on security improvement process which they own and understand
  * Organizational capacity to communicate and store data securely
  * Enhanced organizational capacity
  * Mitigation of critical risks.
  * Contacts and/or next steps for any direct support or training needs of the organization
operational_security: |
  * Be clear on your own data retention and security policy. How are you keeping the audit report, findings, and technical data collected? Balance the need for secure storage, data limitation, and ability to support the organization afterwards. Best practice is to agree this approach clearly with the organization based on their needs and comfort levels.
  * For any specific fixes or upgrades to the system, make sure that backups exist and to test extensively and with staff involvement after your intervention.
  * Do not attempt to train or implement solutions on any topic that you are not knowledgeable on.
  * In addition to ongoing secure communication practices, check for any changes in keys or other authentication changes. If these occur re-verify this information using out-of-band means.

purpose: |
  Follow up from the auditor can be a valuable tool for encouraging an organization to continue their digital security process. This follow up needs to be desired by an organization and achievable for the auditor, thus should be minimally intrusive on both the auditor and the host's time.C

   In-audit activities and training are used to increase an organization's agency
  to seek out and address immediate security challenges within their
  organization, as well as enabling the organization to securely receive and
  store the audit report.
preparation: |
  * Maintain relationships with key personnel
  * Review report & findings and develop plan of action
  * Secure communications options to conduct follow-up discussions with organization
  * Experience giving digital security training
  * Technical skills to address issues, vulnerabilities, or implement solutions
