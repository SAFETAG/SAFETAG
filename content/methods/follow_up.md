summary: >
  This component allows an auditor to explain and get feedback on their report
  as well as evaluate the success of the process over time through a continued
  relationship with the host.


  This component consists of the final meeting with the host and following up with them after a period of a few months to see if they need further assistance, are willing to share their experience working with any of the recommended resources, or as new resources are identified.
