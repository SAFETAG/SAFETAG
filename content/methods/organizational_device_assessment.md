title: Organizational Device Usage
position: 70
summary: |
  This component allows the auditor to discover and assess the security of the
  devices on the network and/or used in the organization. This component
  consists of interviews, surveys, network mapping, and inspection of devices.
short_summary: Discover and assess the security of the devices used in the organization.

guiding_questions: |
  * What work and personal devices do staff use to accomplish their work, store
    work related files, or engage in work communications?
  * What organizational and external/personal services  do staff use to
    accomplish their work, store work related files, or engage in work
    communications?
  * How do staff communicate internal and external? What tools do they use?
  * What are the existing in/formal security practices that the participants use to address risks.
  * Who has physical access to what? Who has remote access to what?
  * When are devices not monitored by trusted staff?
  * How could adversaries gain access? (forced entry, theft, social engineering, seizure)
  * Are there mitigation procedures if devices are lost or taken by adversaries? (e.g.: encrypted drives, offsite backups?)

  * Treat the information learned/collected with the utmost sensitivity and
  security. Physical notes should be destroyed immediately after use and digital
  notes should be kept in line with overall SAFETAG standards.

  * Notes on un/documented access controls measures for the office
  * List of software running on staff devices and date of last update
  * List of known vulnerabilities, and identifiable malware, that the office is vulnerable to.
  * List of malware found by running updated anti-virus on office computers (if anti-virus installed during device inspection.)
  * List of specific unsecured servers, workstations, external hard   drives and any other digital resources

purpose: |
  Compromised devices have the ability to undermine nearly any other
  organizational attempt at securing information. Knowing if devices receive
  basic software and security updates/upgrades and what core protections exist
  against unauthorized access is vital to designing a strategy to make the host
  more secure. Because the SAFETAG framework is focused on the security of data,
  it's also crucial that the physicality of devices on which this data resides,
  including the hard-wired networks through which it's exchanged, be not
  overlooked.
