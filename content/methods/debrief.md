  SAFETAG is an auditing framework designed to connect small civil society
  organizations and independent media outlets to the digital security services
  they need. But, more than that it is designed to provide audits that increase
  an organization's agency to seek out and address security challenges
  independently. This can be an auditor's last in-person chance to engage with
  the staff to shape their perspective of the audit.


  The debrief allows the auditor to ensure that they leave the host and its staff ready to start addressing their digital security issues. By providing some immediate outcomes to the host and its staff, initial psycho-social care and re-framing as needed, and in combination with training or security consultation in the Responsive Support section, the auditor can ensure that the host sees the audit as a guide instead of a condemnation.


  As another good use of debrief activities, the auditor can share with the organization any relevant information about the actual audit process, like the expansion or reduction of the initial scope, specific aspects that required more time, and further areas that might require extra attention, among other things.
