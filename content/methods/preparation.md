  * **Prepare for Travel:** Check travel logistical needs -- visa, letter of invitation, travel tickets and hotel reservations. Note that some visas can take significant effort and may require the auditor to be without a passport while they are being processed.

  * **Prepare Systems:** Update and test your systems, A/V and audit tools[^latest_version_of_tools], prepare storage devices and systems to reflect the required operational security, and ensure you have power supply adapters, cables and relevant adapters, usb drives, external wireless cards and any other equipment needed for testing.

  * Carefully consider packing needs and explanations

purpose: >
  A SAFETAG audit has a short time frame. Preparation is vital to ensure that
  time on the ground is not spent negotiating over the audit scope, updating the
  auditors systems, searching for missing hardware, or refreshing oneself with
  the SAFETAG framework. To that end negotiations with the host organization
  help reveal if the organization has the capacity to undertake the audit and
  respond to its findings.
