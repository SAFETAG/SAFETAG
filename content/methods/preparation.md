guiding_questions: >
  * Does the organization have existing digital security practices or has it
  attempted to implement them in the past?

  * What agreements will govern the audit?

  * What will be the procedure for incident handling in the event that the auditor causes or uncovers an incident during the course of the assessment?

  * What are the legal, physical, or social risks for the auditor & organization associated with conducting the audit or having audit results leak? [^PETS_legal_considerations]

  * Does the security situation of the location or organization require additional planning? Are your software tools up to date and working as expected?

operational_security: >
  * **Prepare Systems:** Update and test your systems, A/V and audit
  tools[^latest_version_of_tools], prepare storage devices and systems to
  reflect the required operational security, and ensure you have power supply
  adapters, cables and relevant adapters, usb drives, external wireless cards
  and any other equipment needed for testing.

  * **Prepare for Travel:** Check travel logistics if needed -- visa, letter of invitation, travel tickets and hotel reservations. Note that some visas can take significant effort and may require the auditor to be without a passport while they are being processed.

  * Carefully consider packing needs and explanations [^travel_kit_appendix]^,^[^NIST_SP_800-115-travel_prep]

title: Preparation
method_icon: /img/preparation_icon.png
purpose: A SAFETAG audit has a short time frame. Preparation is vital to ensure
  that time on the ground is not spent negotiating over the audit scope,
  updating the auditor's systems, searching for missing hardware, or refreshing
  oneself with the SAFETAG framework. Preparatory discussions with the host
  organization help reveal if the organization has the capacity to undertake the
  audit and respond to its findings.
