title: Risk & Threat Analysis
position: 45
summary: |
  This component allows an auditor to lead the host organization's staff in a
  series of activities to identify and prioritize the processes that are
  critical for the organization to carry out its work and to investigate 
  and characterize the threats to those processes and key assets. These activities will
  reveal the consequences if critical processes were interrupted or
  exposed to a malicious actor, who will be understood through threat 
  profiling activities.  This results in the staff creating a risk
  matrix and threat profiles which are used as the foundation of the auditor's recommendations.
short_summary: Identify and map critical organizaional processes and profile the possible attackers in order to develop a risk matrix.

guiding_questions: |
  * What are the critical organizational activities?
  * What threats does the organization, its programs, partners, and beneficiaries face?
  * What would the impact of these threats be if they were to occur?
  * What adversaries (people or groups) may attempt to carry out threats?
  * Are those adversaries capable of carrying out these threats?
  * Do they have the desire and ability to conduct an attack?

  * Maps of critical processes.
  * A list of organizational assets.
  * Threat Actor Profiles
  * Legal context analysis
  * A host driven threat-matrix including the following:
    * **Adversaries** (threat actors) with capabilities and willingness
    * **Impacts** of attacks against **critical processes**, ranked by severity
    * **Likelihood** of each (based on adversaries)
operational_security: |
  * Ensure that any physical notes/drawings are erased and destroyed once digitally recorded.
  * Ensure that any digital recordings of this process are kept secure and encrypted.
  * Consider who has physical and visual access to the room where this process takes place, and if the room can be secured if this activity may span long/overnight breaks.

purpose: |
  Making the host organization's knowledge and experience central to the risk assessment process allows the auditor to put discovered threats and recommendations into the host's own narrative. With greater ownership of the process the staff will be more engaged in addressing the threats identified when the audit is complete. [^social_engineering_important_all] By engaging as many staff as possible the auditor is also providing a framework for staff to examine future concerns when the auditor is gone. The existing in/formal security practices captured during this process will be used to remove organizational and psycho-social barriers to starting new practices.
  
preparation: |
  * Risk Modeling and Proccess Mapping exercises can be intense and challenging to facilitate.   Risk modeling will require a mixed approach of exercises, and the order which you identify each component will vary depending upon the organization. Prepare and review your exercises, and plan for how they will flow together. Note your specific desired outcomes to easily recover or re-direct the activity based on emergent needs. Review the [Frontline Defenders' Risk Assessment Activity](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/sites/default/files/workbook_eng_master.pdf) if needed.
  * Threat Identification discussions, where you facilitate group activities where staff identify possible adversaries and the threats that they have/can leverage against the group, can trigger strong emotions and be draining for the participants. Prepare accordingly to schedule this with downtime (i.e. not right before or after another intense exercise) and to have a plan to address the psychosocial needs of individuals.
  * Initial, limited conversations with senior staff should help scope and guide group exercises
