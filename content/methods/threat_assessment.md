summary: >
  This objective uses a variety of activities to  identify possible attackers
  and gather background information about the capability of those attackers to
  threaten the organization. This consists of identifying a particular
  attacker's history of carrying out specific threats, their capability to carry
  out those threats currently, and proof that the threat has intent to leverage
  resources against the target.
short_summary: Use a variety of activities to  identify possible attackers and gather background information about their capability to threaten the organization.

guiding_questions: >
  * Who are potential adversaries for the organization?

  * Do these threat actors have a history of attacks? Against whom?

  * What types of organizations have they targeted?

  * Does the threat actor have the means to leverage widespread threats against, or will they have to prioritize their targets? Is the organization a priority threat target?

  * Do they have the desire and ability to conduct an attack?

purpose: |
  Checking the assumptions both of the organization and of the auditor by
  researching the current threats will ensure that an auditor is basing their
  work on accurate assessments of the conditions the organization faces and that
  they are making informed operational security considerations. With greater
  ownership of the process the staff provides an opportunity to explore their
  threat landscape and become more engaged in addressing the threats identified
  when the audit is complete. By engaging with as many staff as possible the
  auditor is providing a framework for staff to explore threat identification
  processes when the auditor is gone.
outputs: >
  * A host driven threat-matrix including the following:
    * **Adversaries** (threat actors) with capabilities and willingness
    * **Impacts** of attacks against **critical processes**, ranked by severity
    * **Likelihood** of each (based on adversaries)
  * Latest general cyber-security threats

  * Identify existing in/formal security practices that the participants use to address risks.
operational_security: >
  * Data generated in this component is highly sensitive - in addition to
  standard practices of saving only in encrypted containers and destroying
  physical copy versions (stickies, etc.) ans using VPNs/Tor to conduct
  research, also take note of the physical location where you are conducting any
  exercises to prevent eavesdropping/viewing.

preparation: >
  * Threat Identification works best grounded against mapped out organizational
  processes or a data/asset map. See the [Process
  Mapping](https://safetag.org/methods/risk_modeling) and [Data
  Assessment](https://safetag.org/methods/data_assessment) Methods for exercises
  to generate these.

  * Threat Identification discussions, where you facilitate group activities where staff identify possible adversaries and the threats that they have/can leverage against the group, can trigger strong emotions and be draining for the participants. Prepare accordingly to schedule this with downtime (i.e. not right before or after another intense exercise) and to have a plan to address the psychosocial needs of individuals.

  * Initial, limited conversations with senior staff should help scope and guide group exercises
