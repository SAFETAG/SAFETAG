title: Reporting & Recommendation Development
position: 180
summary: |
  In this component the auditor synthesizes data collected to identify the organization's strengths and weakness (expertise, finance, willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) to adopting new digital and physical security practices and documents the possible actions the organization could take on to address the vulnerabilities found during the audit, the difficulty of taking on those actions, and the resources that the host may be able to leverage to address them. Resources can include, but are not limited to, local technical support and incident response groups/trade organizations, places to obtain discount software, trainers, and guides/resrouces they can use to support their up-skilling. Compile findings into an engagement report and provide a debrief with key points of contact, allowing a space for feedback and planning for follow-up and next steps.
short_summary: Synthesize data collected through the engagement to produce targeted recommendations then provide a report and debrief for the host organization.

guiding_questions: |
  * What are the organizational areas of strength  (expertise, finance, willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) that the organization can leverage when engaging in technological adoption/change?
  * What are the organizational areas of weakness  (expertise, finance, willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) that need to be taken into consideration when engaging in technological adoption/change?
  * What are the organizational barriers to adoption?
  * Are the recommendations you are providing directly related to the security audit? If not, do they support the organization in accomplishing their security tasks, or distract from them?
  * Do key personnel have a general understanding of the initial findings?
  * Does the organization understand the next steps of the audit process?

purpose: |
  The host needs to be able to take action after an audit. The recommendations that an auditor provides to address vulnerabilities must cover a range that allows an organization to address them in both the short-term and more comprehensively in the long-term. Knowing an organization's strengths and weaknesses will allow the auditor to provide more tailored recommendations that an organization will be more likely to attempt and achieve.  In doing this the SAFETAG auditor has an opportunity to act as a trusted conduit between civil society organizations in need and organizations providing digital security training, technological support, legal assistance, and incident response.

  A report and debrief allows the auditor to ensure that they leave the host and its staff ready to start addressing their digital security issues. By providing this immediate outcomes to the host and its staff while providing psycho-social care and re-framing as needed, and in combination with training or security consultation in the Responsive Support section, the auditor can ensure that the host sees the audit as a guide instead of a condemnation. The auditor can share with the organization any relevant information about the actual audit process, like the expansion or reduction of the initial scope, specific aspects that required more time, and further areas that might require extra attention, among other things.
