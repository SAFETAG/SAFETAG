title: Vulnerability Scanning and Analysis
method_icon: "/img/vulnerability_scanning_icon.png"
summary: >
  This component has the auditor discover possible flaws the organization's
  devices, services, application designs, and networks by testing and comparing
  them against a variety of online and offline resources (vulnerability
  databases, vendor advisories, and auditor investigation) to identify known
  vulnerabilities. Basic vulnerability analysis should be occurring along-side
  the other activities so that evidence can be gathered from the network,
  however, deeper research into specific discovered exploits can happen after
  the on-site audit to fully take advantage of the short time the auditor has on
  site.

guiding_questions: >

  * What level of proof do you need to identify to convey the importance (or importance) of a vulnerability to the organization?

  * What would the organization and IT think is an appropriate amount of the IT staffs time that you can request to get the information you need?

    * Lists of OVAL/CVE identifiers for each possibly vulnerable service/system.
    * Examples of live exploits for vulnerabilities where possible.
    * A short write up of each vulnerability including how it was identified.
    * The cleaned up output from any tests used to identify the vulnerability.

    * Document Vulnerabilities (per vulnerability)
      * Write Up
        * Summary - A short (two to three sentence) basic overview of the vulnerability, including a discussion of potential impacts.
        * Description - An in-depth (one to three paragraph) overview of the vulnerability.
        * Approach - Step-by-step explanation of the methodology used that is tool agnostic.
  	  * Proof - The cleaned up output from tests run to identify the vulnerability.

    * Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.
    * Use VPNs or Tor to search if scanning remotely.
    * Seek explicit permission for vulnerability scanning - *NOTE:*  The organization might not be in a position to give you meaningful “permission” to carry out an active remote assessment of "cloud services" used within the organization.
    * In situations where the auditor is doing this work remotely it is important to only run "safe" tests that have no possibility of causing damage to the network.

purpose: >

  It is not uncommon for a cash-strapped human rights NGO to run critical infrastructure themselves on available equipment. A better-resourced organization may host its critical services at a remote data center, or outsource its IT infrastructure to cloud providers, such as Google Apps, and/or to ad-hoc services (Dropbox, Yahoo! mail, Wordpress, etc.). Regardless, it is rare to have someone designated to update and patch systems as vulnerabilities are released, or to view the services from a security -- as opposed to availability -- standpoint.
