purpose: |
  Analysis of context is the foundation of effective risk management. Both
  at-risk organizations and auditors will develop assumptions based upon their
  experience. It is important that an audit is based on information that is
  current and accurate.

  Checking the assumptions both of the organization and of the auditor by researching the current regional and technological context will ensure that an auditor is basing their work on accurate assessments of the conditions the organization faces and that they are making informed operational security considerations.
