summary: |
  During the audit, the auditor provides assistance for any immediate action needed (spot training, tool fixes, consulting on upcoming projects or ongoing activities) -- this may also involve addressing vulnerabilities found that triggered an incident response.

  Note that this in-audit support is not always appropriate and should match the needs and expectations of the organization. Some organizations prioritize an 'audit-only' approach in which no changes are made to systems, vulnerabilities, or staff capacity. In other cases, the organization will benefit from quick action to resolve issues. It is important to document any changes made, and carefully weigh the pros and cons of intervening, given the risks of unintended outcomes. Another risk is that the time spent providing this support will detract from your ability to complete a thorough assessment.

  Ensure you document all work done, strive to engage and build capacity of team members so that they will be able to reproduce and maintain the work you have performed (rather than building dependency), and report on works completed in your final report/debrief. 

  Continuous communication is also critical during assessments, and an in-audit debrief meeting may be offered multiple times, especially for longer engagements.
purpose: |
  In-audit activities and training are used to increase an organization's agency to seek out and address immediate security challenges within their
  organization, as well as enabling the organization to securely receive and store the audit report.
guiding_questions: |
  * Are there any critical vulnerabilities or remediation activities that the
  organization needs a deeper understanding to give proper weight to in the
  report?
  * For any specific fixes or upgrades to the system, make sure that backups exist and to test extensively and with staff involvement after your intervention.
  * How can you prepare the staff and management for aspects of the audit
  process might lead to alienation or inhibit the process?
  * What is the organization's readiness and likelihood to succeed in engaging with security technology?  What factors will complicate or inhibit the effective and safe uptake and use?
  * Is the support you want to provide (troubleshooting, fixes, upgrades,
  training, etc.) critical to the security of the organization? If not, can you provide that support without taking away from the audit?
  * Is the organization making self-directed technology decisions to address the recommendations and vulnerabilities found? If not, will you have the capacity to support new software or hardware that you recommendeded or implemented while providing support? 
operational_security: |
  * If you are providing software tools, make sure to check file signatures (and
  explain the process) - do not be the weak link or introduce malware into the
  organization!
  * Do not attempt to train on any topic that you are not knowledgeable on.
  * For any targeted training, especially on new tools, ensure that key
  personnel at the organization successfully use these tools during the audit
  timeline. This is especially important for secure communications tools the
  auditor hopes to use to follow-up with the organization.
  * For any specific fixes or upgrades to the system, make sure that backups
  exist and to test extensively and with staff involvement after your
  intervention.
preparation: |
  * Experience giving digital security training
  * Each training guide has detailed lists of materials needed and trainer preparation - preview and prepare for any training you plan to give.
  * Technical skills to address issues, vulnerabilities, or implement solutions
outputs: |
 * Vulnerabilities closed or concrete plans made for remediation; incidents responded to.
 * Organizational capacity to communicate and store data securely.
 * Enhanced organizational capacity
 * Mitigation of critical risks.
 * Contacts and/or next steps for any direct support or training needs of the organization
