summary: |
  The auditor provides assistance for any immediate action needed (spot
  training, tool fixes, consulting on upcoming projects) -- this may also
  involve addressing vulnerabilities that triggered an incident response.
purpose: |
  In-audit activities and training are used to increase an organization's agency
  to seek out and address immediate security challenges within their
  organization, as well as enabling the organization to securely receive and
  store the audit report.
guiding_questions: |
  * Are there any critical vulnerabilities or remediation activities that the
  organization needs a deeper understanding to give proper weight to in the
  report?
  * How can you prepare the staff and management for aspects of the audit
  process might lead to alienation or inhibit the process?
  * What is the organization's readiness and likelihood to succeed in engaging
  with security technology?  What factors will complicate or inhibit the
  effective and safe uptake and use?
  * Is the support you want to provide (troubleshooting, fixes, upgrades,
  training, etc.) critical to the security of the organization? If not, can you
  provide that support without taking away from the audit?
  * Will you have the capacity to support software or hardware that you provided
  while providing support?
operational_security: |
  * If you are providing software tools, make sure to check file signatures (and
  explain the process) - do not be the weak link or introduce malware into the
  organization!
  * Do not attempt to train on any topic that you are not knowledgeable on.
  * For any targeted training, especially on new tools, ensure that key
  personnel at the organization successfully use these tools during the audit
  timeline. This is especially important for secure communications tools the
  auditor hopes to use to follow-up with the organization.
  * For any specific fixes or upgrades to the system, make sure that backups
  exist and to test extensively and with staff involvement after your
  intervention.
preparation: |
  #### Baseline Skills

  * Experience giving digital security training
  * Each training guide has detailed lists of materials needed and trainer
  preparation - preview and prepare for any training you plan to give.
outputs: |
  * Organizational capacity to communicate and store data securely
  * Enhanced organizational capacity
  * Mitigation of critical risks.
  * Contacts and/or next steps for any direct support or training needs of the
  organization
