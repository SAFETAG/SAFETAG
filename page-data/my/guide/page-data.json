In other cases, the organization will benefit from quick action to resolve issues. It is important to document any changes made, and carefully weigh the pros and cons of intervening, given the risks of unintended outcomes. Another risk is that the time spent providing this support will detract from your ability to complete a thorough assessment.\n\nEnsure you document all work done, strive to engage and build capacity of team members so that they will be able to reproduce and maintain the work you have performed (rather than building dependency), and report on works completed in your final report/debrief. \n\nContinuous communication is also critical during assessments, and an in-audit debrief meeting may be offered multiple times, especially for longer engagements.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/methods/recommendation_development"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reporting & Recommendation Development","position":180,"method_icon":"/img/responsive_support_icon.png","summary":"In this component the auditor synthesizes data collected to identify the organization's strengths and weakness (expertise, finance, willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) to adopting new digital and physical security practices and documents the possible actions the organization could take on to address the vulnerabilities found during the audit, the difficulty of taking on those actions, and the resources that the host may be able to leverage to address them.
