It can seem difficult to keep updating constantly, but this is very important to protect even non-sensitive systems.</p>\n<p><strong>If Vulnerable Software - Update Vulnerable Software</strong></p>\n<p>Many critical software components, such as Java or Adobe Flash, have many vulnerabilities and need to be aggressively updated.

An out of date anti-virus is worthless. Therefore ensure that continuous udpdating of AV is done.</p>\n<p><strong>If Unencrypted Drive  - Encrypt Hard Drives</strong></p>\n<p>When possible, build-in drive encryption (Filevault on OSX, BitLockeron Windows, and LUKS on Linux) tend to offer the most seamless, user-friendly experiences. VeraCrypt offers free cross-platform drive encryption and cna also create encrypted drives which can be shared across platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>If Inactive firewall - Activate both personal and server firewall (If present)</strong></p>\n<p>Again, where present, use built-in firewalls and configure them for both office and public network options.
