In this case, the auditor will instruct the intermediary or the tech person in the organization to follow the instructions in the exercise on <a href=\"#network-mapping\">Network mapping</a> and on <a href=\"#user-device-assessment\">User device assessment</a>.</p></section>\n<section><h6 id=\"scenario-1\">Scenario 1</h6><p>The organization has someone among their employees who is ready to follow simple instructions, including opening a terminal and pasting commands we will provide them.</p><p>In this scenario, the auditor will send simple instructions to the auditee, so as to be able to access the organization's network through a reverse SSH tunnel and assess the LAN and single devices from there. To run the computer used within the organization's network to establish the tunnel, a UNIX system is needed. This will be a Linux live distribution or a Mac computer.</p></section>\n<section><h6 id=\"scenario-2\">Scenario 2</h6><p>In this scenario, no one at the organization is ready to apply complex instructions. Instead of relying on an individual, the auditor will rely on  tunneling into a device located in the physical space of the auditee. This can be done in two ways:</p><ol>\n<li>Remote Desktop or remote VPN into targeted Network. Remote Desktop is  tunneling into a targeted machine that lives on the same targeted LAN network  where you wish to scan the network and do the device assessment; the auditor controls the machine remotely and uses it as the auditor machine.</li>\n<li>VPN to a trusted VPN server. In this case, the auditee will connect one of their machines to a trusted VPN server, and the auditor will connect to the same VPN server, allowing both LANs at the auditee's and auditor's ends to connect.</li>\n</ol></section>"},"materials_needed":{"html":"<section><h6 id=\"scenario-1\">Scenario 1</h6><ul>\n<li>A machine accessible globally via ssh.

The remote port is an arbitrary high number port (> 1023); a practice can be established to assign a number to each location and machine.</p>\n<p><strong>example</strong>:</p>\n<p>the auditee on machine on site 0 could be instructed to run:</p>\n<pre><code>ssh -R 2200:localhost:22 auditee0@safetag-audit.org\n</code></pre>\n<p>this will allow the auditee to connect to port 2200 from within safetag-audit.org (S) and have traffic forwarded to port 22 on the auditee's machine (C).</p>\n<p>the auditee on machine on site 1 will run:</p>\n<pre><code>ssh -R 2210:localhost:22 auditee1@safetag-audit.org\n \n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Important</strong>: make sure that the ports you use don't conflict with ports by other services or auditees, i.e. don't use a port number twice.</p><p>Once this session is open, the auditor can access the auditee's machine (C). At this point there are a few powerful options:</p><ul>\n<li>\n<p>simply ssh from S to C via the tunnel (port defined in the reverse tunnel on the server localhost interface); </p>\n<p><strong>example</strong>:</p>\n<p>to connect to site 0:</p>\n<pre><code>ssh clientUser@localhost -p 2200\n</code></pre>\n<p>with site 1 in the previous example, the port would be 2210 (or whatever the auditee used in her command).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create a VPN-like connection to site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>create a forward tunnel from A to S that is \"piped\" into the reverse tunnel:</p>\n<pre><code>ssh -L 2200:localhost:2200 user@safetag-audit.org\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>now you have a tunnel from your localhost:2200 to  safetag-audit.org:2200, which in turn has a tunnel from  safetag-audit.org:2200 to the client machine on port 22.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>once you have that, you can use <a href=\"https://sshuttle.readthedocs.io\">sshuttle</a> (needs to be installed, it's in most Linux standard repositories) on the auditor's machine (A) to access additional resources in the auditee's network (as long as they are non-ICMP) directly from the Auditor's machine (A). Such resources might include web-based resources (router web interface for example) or remote desktop (to assess windows or mac clients) or accessing file shares on the auditee's network, etc... </p>\n<p>to do this, you would need to use client credentials through the tunnel you just created, and provide the client subnet to route traffic correctly through that \"VPN\":</p>\n<pre><code>sshuttle -r user@localhost:2200 192.168.1.0/24\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> once this tunnel is created, you should be able to access any resource on the remote network by its IP and port (for example, through the browser for http(s))</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p>An additional thing that one might want to do is making the connection from C to S passwordless and automatic (this can be accomplished with tools or scripts readily available on the internet).</p><p><strong><em>WARNING</em></strong>: Make sure to remove/clean any persistent connections once you are done with auditing.</p><p>There should be no need for multiple reverse tunnels, as multiple forward tunnels can be set up from S to C if needed (eg. VNC or RDP); this requires multiple forward tunnels from A to S though.</p></section>\n<section><h6 id=\"scenario-2\">Scenario 2</h6><p><strong>Legend</strong>:</p><ul>\n<li>A: Auditee's local machine; a clean machine, connected to the Internet through the auditee's LAN network</li>\n<li>B: Auditor machine</li>\n</ul><p>Someone at the auditee's side will prepare machine A in coordination with the auditor, then install <a href=\"https://www.teamviewer.com/en/\">TeamViewer</a>.</p><p>After that, and using a trusted communication method, TeamViewer ID and passcode will be sent to the Auditor.</p><p>The auditor will use the ID and passcode to connect to the machine and start using machine A as the auditing machine.</p><p>There are pros and cons for this: </p><p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p><ol>\n<li>Internet speed: You will need a high speed Internet connection to achieve such task, as the remote access will be transferring the desktop of the targeted machine to you in order to do the tasks.</li>\n<li>Connection interruption: While you are working remotely, you might face some connection interruptions during your session, and restarting the remote access will be a challenge because in most of the cases you will need someone at the other end to authorize you to tunnel into the machine.</li>\n<li>Physical limitations: You are still physically far from the machine, which means you cannot connect a USB drive to boot from it or do any other tasks that require you to be near the device.</li>\n<li>Installing Kali Linux might be hard: It might be hard for a non-technical person to prepare a Kali Linux machine</li>\n</ol><p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p><ol>\n<li>Usability: TeamViewer is easy to install and use. Anyone with basic knowledge on how to install software can assist you with preparing the auditing machine.</li>\n<li>Network speed: Technically, your auditing machine is the machine you are connected to, which is physically located in the targeted office and connected to the LAN network. This means that you will have full speed running your audit tasks.</li>\n</ol><p><strong>Note</strong>: Some remote assistant software provides VPN solutions that turn Machine A into a VPN Server and allow Machine B to VPN into it. Tunneling into that VPN server will allow you to connect to the local LAN network, which will allow you to use Machine B to run the audit.</p></section>\n<section><h6 id=\"using-an-in-the-middle-trusted-vpn-server\">Using an in-the-middle trusted VPN server</h6><p><strong>Legend</strong>:</p><ul>\n<li>A : Auditee's local machine; a clean machine, connected to the Internet through the auditee's LAN network</li>\n<li>B: Auditor's machine</li>\n<li>C: OpenVPN Server</li>\n</ul><p>Auditee's Network --------- (A) ---------- C ---------- (B) ---------- Auditor's Network</p><p>The auditor will put efforts preparing an OpenVPN server (C) and create 2 profiles (Keys and configurations) to allow machines A and B to connect to C.</p><p>Get a VPS from your favorite and trusted VPS provider and keep in mind the physical location of the server, then install OpenVPN Server by following the instructions contained in <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/openvpn.html\">this guide on Ubuntu Server</a>.</p><p>The default configuration of OpenVPN will not allow the clients (A-B) to see each other on the network.
