The organization may be interested in your assessment of the security of those services. This poses several challenges to you as an auditor:</p>\n<pre><code>* auditing 3rd party web applications almost certainly falls outside of the scope of the audit engagement\n* you likely do not have an agreement with the service provider to scan their application\n* a proper assessment would take more time than is available for the organizational audit\n* you may not be familiar with the service or technology it is built on\n</code></pre>\n<p>Despite these challenges, significant organizational processes and sensitive data may reside on or rely upon those 3rd party applications. It can be important to the audit to provide some preliminary investigation and risk assessment into the usage of any 3rd party cloud services they rely upon.</p>"},"walk_through":{"html":"<p>It is increasingly difficult to run complex organizations without some reliance on cloud-based service providers such as email hosting, web hosting, or document management/backup. Organizations (and as assisted by the auditor) should review their options in the selection of cloud providers, and in parallel consider ways to apply practices and policies to their use to meet organizational security requirements.</p>"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/activities/cloud_services"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
