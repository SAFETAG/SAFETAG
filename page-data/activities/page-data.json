It is one stage where it will allow you to discover more\npotential targets.

Along with these, you can also have a broader scope of\ntargets, such as internal server IP addresses, company netblocks and\ndomain/subdomain names.\n\nDNS Enumeration can be accomplished with different number of tools along with\ndifferent approaches.

Scanning should always be the first step, preventing you from spending excess time if the machine was infected with a less serious piece of malware.\n\nAfter determining the machine is infected, you can proceed in helping the staff member back up their information, scanning the files for malware, then reformatting the infected machine. Note, it is very difficult to clean an infected machine if you only have a short window of time.\n\nIn case the machine was infected, taking an image of the operating system will allow you to replicate the infected machine and run it after you finish your audit for a more in-depth investigation or send it to an expert to work on investigating the malware. Note, this also can be difficult in an audit setting where time is limited.
