You can consider it as telephone directory of the Internet.\n\nDNS enumeration is one of your initial steps in your overall vulnerability\nassessment and audit. It is one stage where it will allow you to discover more\npotential targets. Upon completion of this assessment stage, you may find\nissues such as leaked information caused by default settings and server\nmisconfigurations. Along with these, you can also have a broader scope of\ntargets, such as internal server IP addresses, company netblocks and\ndomain/subdomain names.\n\nDNS Enumeration can be accomplished with different number of tools along with\ndifferent approaches. This guide will discuss some of the approaches and the\ntools required to perform each of the activities. You can perform DNS\nenumeration passively or actively, depending on your operational security\nneeds.\n\n**Passive**, or \"indirect\" approach refers to the enumeration process that\ndoesn't send any traffic or packets from your machine, directly to your\ntarget.

Malware like a Remote\nAccess Trojan (or RAT) can provide an attacker with backdoor access to a\ntargeted machine, enabling the attacker to steal information, record audio and\nvideo, as well as run commands on the infected machine.\n\nTo stop this from happening, you have to identify the malicious process within the system and stop it, or reformatting the machine in case you don’t feel spending time on stopping the malicious process.\n\nIt’s important to keep evidence, in case the auditee still has access to the original malicious software they received (e.g., an email, etc.), keep a copy of the file if you have the time and expertise to continue investigating or have the resources to submit it to other organizations working on analyzing such issues.\n\nScanning the possible infected machine or the original suspicious file with an anti-virus will save you time and effort, in the case such malware is already in its database. Scanning should always be the first step, preventing you from spending excess time if the machine was infected with a less serious piece of malware.\n\nAfter determining the machine is infected, you can proceed in helping the staff member back up their information, scanning the files for malware, then reformatting the infected machine. Note, it is very difficult to clean an infected machine if you only have a short window of time.\n\nIn case the machine was infected, taking an image of the operating system will allow you to replicate the infected machine and run it after you finish your audit for a more in-depth investigation or send it to an expert to work on investigating the malware. Note, this also can be difficult in an audit setting where time is limited.
