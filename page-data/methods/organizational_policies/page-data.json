They still have to navigate the myriad of taxiways and park at the gate safely. The same is true of you and your pen test reports, just because its finished doesn't mean you can switch off entirely. You still have to get the report out to the client, and you have to do so securely. Electronic distribution using public key cryptography is probably the best option, but not always possible. If symmetric encryption is to be used, a strong key should be used and must be transmitted out of band. Under no circumstances should a report be transmitted unencrypted. It all sounds like common sense, but all too often people fall down at the final hurdle.\" - <a href=\"http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/writing-penetration-testing-reports/\">The Art of Writing Penetration Test Reports</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-secure_reporting\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-stares_and_snide_comments\">\n<p>\"I once performed a social engineering test, the results of which were less than ideal for the client. The enraged CEO shared the report with the whole organization, as a way of raising awareness of social engineering attacks. This was made more interesting, when I visited that same company a few weeks later to deliver some security awareness training. During my introduction, I explained that my company did security testing and was responsible for the social engineering test a few weeks back. This was greeted with angry stares and snide comments about how I’d gotten them all into trouble.
