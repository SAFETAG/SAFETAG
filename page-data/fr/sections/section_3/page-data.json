Resources can include, but are not limited to, local technical support and incident response groups/trade organizations, places to obtain discount software, trainers, and guides/resrouces they can use to support their up-skilling.</p>\n<h3>Objectif</h3>\n<p>The host needs to be able to take action after an audit. The recommendations that an auditor provides to address vulnerabilities must cover a range that allows an organization to address them in both the short-term and more comprehensively in the long-term. Knowing an organization's strengths and weaknesses will allow the auditor to provide more tailored recommendations that an organization will be more likely to attempt and achieve. In doing this the SAFETAG auditor has an opportunity to act as a trusted conduit between civil society organizations in need and organizations providing digital security training, technological support, legal assistance, and incident response.</p>\n<h3>Questions directrices</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the organizational areas of strength  (expertise, finance,\nwillingness to learn, staff time, etc.) that the organization can leverage\nwhen engaging in technological adoption/change?</li>\n<li>What are the organizational areas of weakness  (expertise, finance,\nwillingness to learn, staff time, etc.) that need to be taken into\nconsideration when engaging in technological adoption/change?</li>\n<li>What are the organizational barriers to adoption?</li>\n<li>Are the recommendations you are providing directly related to the security\naudit?

The auditor prioritizes vulnerabilities, weighs the implementation costs of recommendations and then creates an actionable roadmap for the organization to make their own informed choices about possible next steps as they move forward.</p>\n<h3>Objectif</h3>\n<p>As part of SAFETAG's dedication to building agency and supporting organizational adoption of safer practices, a careful prioritization of vulnerabilities is invaluable in keeping audit results from appearing overwhelming. An organization needs to be able to weigh their possible paths forward against the time lost from program activities, the cost to implement the threat, and the other threats that they are not addressing. Roadmapping is used to give the host the tools to make these decisions and provide them with a recommended path forward that will allow them to make immediate gains towards protecting themselves. The existing in/formal security practices captured during this process will be used to remove organizational and psyco-social barriers to starting new practices.</p>\n<h3>Baseline Skills</h3>\n<h3>Préparation</h3>\n<h3>Documents nécessaires</h3>\n<h3>Approche</h3>\n<h3>Sorties</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A risk matrix with all vulnerabilities ranked on it.</li>\n<li>An \"implementation matrix\" showing each recommendation in relation to its difficulty to implement and its urgency.</li>\n<li>An overview of the risks the organization is accepting until they address each vulnerability.</li>\n<li>A short overview of the how the likelihood was determined for vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li>A listing of the process, impact, and likelihood for each vulnerability.</li>\n<li>A roadmap for a \"recommended path\" to address the threats the host faces.</li>\n<li>A short description of why a recommendation (and corresponding threat) was ranked with the urgency it was assigned.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sécurité opérationnelle</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The roadmap may be shared with local IT support, digital security trainers, possible funders, or other consultants in part, or in full. Consider the content in light of this.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Individual vulnerabilities should be able to be read, and acted upon, independently from the rest of the report so that the organization can easily provide only the required information for follow up work.</li>\n<li>The overall posture and risk/ranking profile components should be able to be read independent from the risk model and be free of any specific vulnerabilities to allow the organization to easily provide trusted invested parties with an overview of the results/need without exposing any specific vulnerabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization’s country, or is known to surveil.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Guide:</em> <a href=\"https://www.eisf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/0593-EISF-2010-Risk-Thresholds-in-Humanitarian-Assistance.pdf\">\"Risk Thresholds in Humanitarian Assistance\"</a> (eisf)</li>\n<li><em>Guide:</em> <a href=\"https://www.eisf.eu/library/guide-to-security-management-planning/\">\"Guide to Security Management Planning\"</a> (eisf)</li>\n<li><em>Guide:</em> <a href=\"https://www.eisf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/0241-Garrett-2005-Security-awareness-culture.pdf\">\"Developing a Security-Awareness Culture - Improving Security Decision Making\"</a> (SANS InfoSec Reading Room)</li>\n<li><em>Book:</em> \"The Order of Mitigation - p. 131\" (Threat Modeling - Adam Shostack)<a href=\"https://safetag.org/guide/#fn91\">91</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Création de rapport</h2>\n<p>\"<em>A good analysis might turn the threats into stories so they stay close to mind as software is being written or reviewed.

If written with care it can be a tool to encourage agency and guide adoption. The report has many audiences who will need to use it in different ways. For the auditor and the organization, it acts as documentation of what an auditor accomplished. For the organization, it will be guide for connecting vulnerabilities to actual risks, a rallying cry for change, and proof of need for funders. For those the organization brings in to support their digital security, it provides a roadmap towards that implementation and a task-list for future technologists and trainers paid to get the host there - as well as a checklist for validating that threats have been addressed.</p>\n<h3>Baseline Skills</h3>\n<h3>Préparation</h3>\n<h3>Documents nécessaires</h3>\n<h3>Approche</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Create charts and visuals for roadmap, risk-matrix, implementation matrix, and critical processes.</li>\n<li>Compile approaches, impact, risk, recommendations and resources for each vulnerability.</li>\n<li>Prepare narrative components.</li>\n<li>Write explanations for why any adversaries or threats that the auditor identifies as \"un-addressable\" with the organizations current capacity.</li>\n<li>Collect agreements &#x26; scope.</li>\n<li>Document tools used for testing where needed.</li>\n<li>Update glossary where needed.</li>\n<li>Compile full report contents.</li>\n<li>Send the report to client. <a href=\"https://safetag.org/guide/#fn93\">93</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sorties</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A completed report delivered securely to the organizational point of contact.</li>\n<li>Documented process examples to submit back to SAFETAG.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sécurité opérationnelle</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Treat the report with the utmost security.
