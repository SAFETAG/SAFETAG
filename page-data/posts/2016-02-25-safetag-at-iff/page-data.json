Towards this, we joined with a group of 15 practitioners recently in Prague who are working on all aspects of organizational security, from the audit/assessment piece through to implementation and follow-up support. We all shared experiences, resources and approaches to address our collective challenges by coalescing our understanding of what organizational security is, and how we can grow and hone our practice.</p>\n<p>We were all very encouraged and buoyed by the depth and breadth of the collective knowledge to be tapped, and resolved to use this as a launching pad towards a larger knowledge space and a community of practice.</p>\n<p>If you are attending the <a href=\"https://internetfreedomfestival.org/\">Internet Freedom Festival</a>, we invite you to join the discussion, hear our outline of how to grow as an independent, open, and collaborative community; and if you are interested, to join efforts.</p>\n<p>There is an initial session Thursday March 3 Noon-1 focused on building a more collaborative assessment framework based out of SAFETAG, followed up by an all-morning session scheduled for Friday 10–1, March 4. We want to hear from you about the challenges you face implementing organizational security support and your solutions; about your own organizational security systems and practices; and how you could benefit and contribute as an active member of this growing community.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Dubrovnik_ccBY_JonCamfield.JPG\" alt=\"Dubrovnik Lock CC-BY Jon Camfield\" title=\"Dubrovnik Lock CC-BY Jon Camfield\"></p>\n<p>This comment has been adapted from a cross-organizational posting which has included the below people and organizations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ali G.
