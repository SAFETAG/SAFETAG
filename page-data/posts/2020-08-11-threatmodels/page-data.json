These are not simply idealized stereotypes, however - they are created by the at-risk users themselves to provide authentic insight into the lived experiences, needs, and threats of these communities without putting any specific members of their community at risk. These personas provide critical insights into the needs and threats real people face in challenging environments. Tools for these communities need to be resilient against a wide variety of technical, physical, and legal attacks while also being easy to use, with little or no training.</p><!--[**User Personas**](https://usable.tools/personas/), or anonymized profiles of end-users, provide a critical insight into the people who engage -- or whom developers want to engage -- with tools.

The framework provides a <a href=\"https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/exercises/technical_context_research\">guide to research the technical capacity of potential threat actors</a>, including both historical attack data and any indicators of changes to their capacity.

Secure messaging, calls, and document collaboration are all significantly more complex when you have multiple people or organizations involved, and tools which are relatively easy to swap in and out at a personal level become incredibly more complex if an entire organization depends upon them as a core part of their workflow.</p></td><td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding: 15px;\" ><p><strong>Adversary Personas will contain realistic details of generalized adversaries’ capacities and what issues these actors are willing to expend resources and build capacity to undermine.</strong></p><p>Organizations will be able to use these resources to anticipate potential threats and malicious actions and proactively develop practices and responses to realistic situations. This will enable developers, trainers, policymakers, funders, and others to contextualize their work against a wider variety of threat actors without having to rely on any one specific nation-state as a \"bogeyman.\" I specifically hope this enables richer conversation around actual threats while removing cultural stereotypes and prejudices.</p></td></tr></table></section>\n<section><h2 id=\"from-resources-to-practice\">From Resources to Practice</h2><p>These are collectively designed to enable unbiased discussions and\nstrategy development around the serious challenges and threats users,\norganizations, and entire communities face, the tools we use to help,\nand tools, practices, or policies we wish we had.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Responses focused on threats, not just threat actors</strong> Threat\nactors change and evolve, and often have more capacity than is\npublicly confirmed (but perhaps less than is presumed through\nrumor). By extracting and de-personalizing aspects of this, we can\nhave clearer discussions. Further, specifying current existing\nactors, especially in open source tools, can overly complicate the\npublic profile of the tool as well as those using it. If a tool is\nclearly built to combat a specific actor, then users of that tool\ncan be seen as inherently being aligned against that actor. This has\nresulted already in excessive targeting and jailing of activists\nbased on their tool choice.</li>\n<li><strong>Identification of common, cross-regional threats</strong> What attacks,\nspecific techniques, and even malicious tools are being used and\nre-used globally? Are there patterns we can detect and build\nproactive defenses against?</li>\n<li><strong>Gap identification</strong> What gaps remain when we look at this data\nmapped out? Is anyone working to address them? What solutions\n(tools, training, policy changes) could be used? How do we\nsustainably build these resources?</li>\n<li><strong>More dynamic responses, more resilient communities</strong> By tackling\nthe inputs into this process separately, we can update our models\nmore agilely and plan against a wider variety of attacks to build\ntools and guidance that are more resilient to more types of threat\nactors as well as changes in any specific actor.</li>\n<li><strong>Future-looking strategies</strong> With these fictional personas and\narchetypes, we do not have to be as limited to current actors and\ntheir capacities. We can (within reason) consider possible future\nthreats that activists may face by remixing and extrapolating from\ncurrent threats. Anticipating these risks will allow us to build\ntools to mitigate sooner, rather than later. <em>Dystopian cyberpunk\nscenarios welcome!</em></li>\n<li>These resources can be used to develop <strong>tabletop scenarios</strong> to\nexplore current and emerging threats and build creative responses to\nthem. These scenarios are useful in advanced trainings, tool\ndevelopment, and strategy building exercises. Fictional but\nrealistic adversaries and personas can get into detail around\nspecific threats and mitigations without being as personal, risking\nbias, and helping reduce potential of trauma involved in these\ndiscussions.</li>\n</ul><br /><p>We are just getting started and would love to hear from you on what\ndata you hope to find in these resources, how you would use and adapt\nthem, and more!
