However, they require significant time investment, and present numerous additional challenges. For example, remote trust building is tricky, and many people are uncomfortable enabling remote device access. Technical barriers like poor internet connectivity or lack of tech skills among staff may emerge. Finally, it is impossible to provide full technical support if something goes wrong that can't be fixed remotely.</li>\n<li><strong>Web-based digital security guides are not dead (but keep them simple)!</strong> Websites with complicated interactive guides addressing specific threat models don’t get sustained engagement and are difficult and expensive to maintain long-term. In contrast, sites with a set of searchable, specific, and updated instructions for different tools and cases can be a useful resource for post-audit and training communications and remote support and incident response. In addition, they are easier to keep up-to-date.</li>\n<li><strong>It’s crucial to tailor security audit reports to the audience in mind.</strong> Whether the report is for management or IT staff with technical know-how will dictate the specificity and structure of the report. There was community consensus that risk should be the focus of audit reports. Shorter reports focusing on action steps may be useful for organizations with limited bandwidth and interest in holistic security; in-depth reports detailing the process and connecting recommendations to risk are a more useful resource for organizations wishing to replicate the process down the line or build their own internal digital security expertise.</li>\n<li><strong>When developing organizational security policies, don’t start from scratch!</strong> There are many existing policy frameworks for practitioners to draw upon when assisting civil society organizations. Start with <a href=\"https://www.usesoap.app\">SOAP</a>, <a href=\"https://sdamanual.org/\">SDA</a>, and resources from <a href=\"https://communitydocs.accessnow.org/370-Organizational_Security_Policy.html\">Access Now</a> and the <a href=\"https://orgsec.community/display/OS/Creating+organisational+security+policies\">OrgSec Wiki</a>.</li>\n</ul></section>\n<section><h3 id=\"its-not-too-late-to-register\">It’s not too late to register!</h3><p><strong>Join us for more sessions throughout the week on OrgSec in Practice, Advanced Threats, Funding Models, and more!</strong></p><p>Register at: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_vzeIABKyYt1pMiq4_Ka-Ffk8kcjGmHnJQw9-n2UCfjAbig/viewform\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd<em>vzeIABKyYt1pMiq4</em>Ka-Ffk8kcjGmHnJQw9-n2UCfjAbig/viewform</a></p><div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"/img/blog/IFFOSV_Title.svg\" alt=\"Five OrgSec Village Themes are 1.
