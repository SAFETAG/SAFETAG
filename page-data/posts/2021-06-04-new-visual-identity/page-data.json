The feedback we received made it clear that one of the most important values of SAFETAG is the community-driven focus and we hope that this new visual identity and web interface encapsulates that aspect.</p>\n<section><h3 id=\"new-logo-and-design-assets\">New logo and design assets</h3><p><img src=\"/img/blog/logosmall.jpg\" alt=\"Blue rectangle outline with the word &#x27;safetag&#x27; in blue on the left, and a filled in blue square on the right with a white lock and a circle on top inside the square.\">\nAs part of the new visual identity, Tafka Co-op worked with Internews and the broader SAFETAG community to update and/or create the following assets:</p><ul>\n<li>Updated logo, shown above</li>\n<li>New color palette</li>\n<li>New iconography set</li>\n<li>New customizable graphics</li>\n<li>New accessibility guidance</li>\n<li>Sample presentation slides</li>\n<li>Sample print configurations</li>\n</ul><p>One of our priorities when redesigning the SAFETAG interface was to make the framework more usable. A lot of the feedback received showed that new auditors had trouble following the framework, knowing where to begin, how many activities to use in their audit, etc. In response to this, we developed new iconography which will help guide auditors through the interface and framework based on their needs. A total of <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/ATTHbHSGthsteeXP4gnlxF/Safetag-%E2%86%92-Branding-system?node-id=55%3A0\">20 icons</a> were developed, however the three that will be used to represent each type of activity are shown below. </p><p><img src=\"/img/blog/TRI.png\" alt=\"Technical: Blue and Orange graphic. The blue line is behind the orange line with two open semi-circle at the top left and bottom right of the line. Orange line goes across from bottom left to top right in the shape of an X across the blue. Text below the graphic reads &#x27;Technical.&#x27; Interpersonal: Blue and Orange graphic with zig-zagged open semi-circles in alternating blue and orange colors horizontally across the middle, with two blue dots at the top above the blue open semi-circles, and one orange dot at the bottom below the orange open semi-circle. Text below the graphic reads &#x27;Interpersonal&#x27;. Research: Graphic shows a blue magnifying glass made of a basic circle and line, with an orange vertical line, blue square, and orange triangle on the inside of the circle. Text below graphic reads &#x27;Research.&#x27;\"></p><p>Each SAFETAG audit is custom-built to the needs of the organization which is being audited. Designed with this in mind, the logo and all icons were built using a series of shapes and colors, or elements, arranged to represent each activity. These elements are used as building blocks, combining to form each icon. </p><p><img src=\"/img/blog/shapes.png\" alt=\"Basic shapes graphic: Graphic shows, from left to right, a blue circle, a blue open semi-circle, an orange triangle, blue square, and orange circle arranged vertically, a vertical blue rectangle, an orange open circle, and a horizontal blue rectangle. Text below the graphic reads &#x27;Basic shapes are configured to represent methods and activities such as Physical Assessment, Responsive Support, and Organizational Device Usage. Physical Assessment Icon: Blue rectangle with a small graphic of a person on top, with an orange circle, a blue square, and an orange triangle arranged horizontally inside the rectangle. Text reads Physical Assessment Icon. Responsive Support Icon: Blue checkmark with an orange triangle at the top of the shorter end, and an orange circle at the top of the longer end on the right. Text reads Responsive Support Icon. Organizational Device Usage Icon: Blue brackets with an orange circle, blue square, orange triangle, blue triangle, orange circle, and blue square arranged in two lines inside of the brackets. Text reads Organizational Device Usage Icon.\"></p><p><em>Basic shapes are configured to represent methods and activities such as Physical Assessment, Responsive Support, and Organizational Device Usage.</em></p><p>Individually, each shape represents a specific element of SAFETAG (such as data, organization, individual, etc.), and when configured together, represent a larger concept or method (such as Organizational Device Usage or Physical Assessment). </p><p>We are prioritizing a community-driven approach by hosting these assets on Figma, a platform that is free to use and allows full customization of the design assets.
