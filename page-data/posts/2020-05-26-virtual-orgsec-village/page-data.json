Each session will last approximately 50 minutes, with a short break in between sessions. We will be sharing a schedule and additional information on each session prior to the event. You are invited to join as many or as few sessions as you would like!</p>\n<p>We recognize that some folks may not be able to join due to timing or prior engagements. To ensure that everyone has the opportunity to contribute in some way, non-attributed, editable notes from each session will be made available. We will also use the IFF Mattermost for asynchronous collaboration and networking. <strong>If you do not have an IFF Mattermost account, please email <a href=\"mailto:team@internetfreedomfestival.org\">team@internetfreedomfestival.org</a></strong>.</p>\n<h2>Registration and CoC</h2>\n<p>Please let us know you will be attending by registering here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_vzeIABKyYt1pMiq4_Ka-Ffk8kcjGmHnJQw9-n2UCfjAbig/viewform\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_vzeIABKyYt1pMiq4_Ka-Ffk8kcjGmHnJQw9-n2UCfjAbig/viewform</a>.</p>\n<p>We ask that you register even if you are only able to attend a few days or sessions.
