## Vulnerability Scanning and Analysis

### Summary
This component has the auditor discover possible flaws the organization's devices, services, application designs, and networks by testing and comparing them against a variety of online and offline resources (vulnerability databases, vendor advisories, and auditor investigation) to identify known vulnerabilities. Basic vulnerability analysis should be occurring along-side the other activities so that evidence can be gathered from the network, however, deeper research into specific discovered exploits can happen after the on-site audit to fully take advantage of the short time the auditor has on site.

### Purpose

It is not uncommon for a cash-strapped human rights NGO to run critical infrastructure themselves on available equipment. A better-resourced organization may host its critical services at a remote data center, or outsource its IT infrastructure to cloud providers, such as Google Apps, and/or to ad-hoc services (Dropbox, Yahoo! mail, Wordpress, etc.). Regardless, it is rare to have someone designated to update and patch systems as vulnerabilities are released, or to view the services from a security -- as opposed to availability -- standpoint.

### The Flow Of Information
![Vulnerability Analysis Information Flow](images/info_flows/vulnerability_scanning.svg)

### Guiding Questions

* What level of proof do you need to identify to convey the importance (or importance) of a vulnerability to the organization?
* What would the organization and IT think is an appropriate amount of the IT staffs time that you can request to get the information you need?




### Outputs

  * Lists of OVAL/CVE identifiers for each possibly vulnerable service/system.
  * Examples of live exploits for vulnerabilities where possible.
  * A short write up of each vulnerability including how it was identified.
  * The cleaned up output from any tests used to identify the vulnerability.

  * Document Vulnerabilities (per vulnerability)
    * Write Up
      * Summary - A short (two to three sentence) basic overview of the vulnerability, including a discussion of potential impacts.
      * Description - An in-depth (one to three paragraph) overview of the vulnerability.
      * Approach - Step-by-step explanation of the methodology used that is tool agnostic.
	  * Proof - The cleaned up output from tests run to identify the vulnerability.

### Operational Security

  * Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.
  * Use VPNs or Tor to search if scanning remotely.
  * Seek explicit permission for vulnerability scanning - *NOTE:*  The organization might not be in a position to give you meaningful “permission” to carry out an active remote assessment of "cloud services" used within the organization.
  * In situations where the auditor is doing this work remotely it is important to only run "safe" tests that have no possibility of causing damage to the network. 


### Preparation
<!-- NIST Special Publication 800-115 Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment -->

#### Baseline Skills

* **Vulnerability Scanning:** : General TCP/IP and networking knowledge; knowledge of ports, protocols, services, and vulnerabilities for a variety of operating systems; ability to use automated vulnerability scanning tools and interpret/analyze the results

* **Penetration Testing:** Extensive TCP/IP, networking, and OS knowledge; advanced knowledge of network and system vulnerabilities and exploits; knowledge of techniques to evade security detection
