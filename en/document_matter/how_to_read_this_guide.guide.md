### Objective Components

#### Summary

A short - one to four sentence - basic overview of the objective.

#### Purpose

The justification for why we have included this objective.

#### The Flow of Information

The purpose of audit activities is to acquire risk assessment and mitigation information. As this information is acquired, earlier audit steps will have to be re-visited based upon updated information. The "Flow of Information" shows the types of information that an audit objective builds upon (input), and the types of information that it may reveal (outcomes).

#### Guiding Questions

Each audit objective is guided by a small set of core questions. Key questions are included to help an auditor identify when they have acquired enough information and customize their approach while still collecting the correct types of information to support the organization.

#### Approaches

Many of these objectives can be completed in multiple ways depending upon auditor skill and the organizational technical setup and capacity. The approach section includes a list of activites that can be used to carry out parts, or the whole, of the information collection for an audit activity.

#### Resources

Links to resources that can be used to deepen an auditors understanding.
