### 1 Critical Process Mapping
The goal of this exercise is for the trainee to lead the host participants in "brain-storming" a list of all the processes that are critical for their work.

Process mapping in SAFETAG is done as a highly simplified version of data-flow diagramming. The auditor has the participants describe the process step-by-step. As they describe the process the auditor uses labeled circles to represent any individuals, services, or organizations that are a part of a critical process and connects them with directional arrows to represent any communication or exchange of goods.  When finished these diagram should be clear and easily understood by staff who did not participate.

workshop"](https://noppa.lut.fi/noppa/opintojakso/a350a0000/lisatty/r_1999_f_lscher_anatomy_of_a_process_mapping_workshop.pdf) (Jan Fulscher)

With the processes that compose the core work of the organization identified, the next step is to identify the subset of activities that are critical to their work. The processes identified here will be what the auditor uses as a frame for the rest of their audit and reporting. Helping the organization triage these processes is at the core of how an auditor continues their assessment. An auditor uses this subset to guide their audit. If an auditor is not mindful of making sure that there are processes among the critical processes identified that speak to the full range of participants their recommendations are more likely to meet resistance.

Note that this can be a time consuming activity -- manage the time to complete the entire needs assessment, and respect the time constraints of the staff. It is also important to be clear that many organizations have multiple "required" processes - failure to pay the utility bills (or staff!) is certain to cause disruptions as much as website downtime or hacked email accounts.  It is important for the auditor to facilitate this process carefully, so as not to alienate aspects of the organization while at the same time focusing in on a process that will yield valuable discussion once the conversation moves to risks and threats.

If attendees get distracted by enumerating the technology used for data-flows or identifying new threats let them know they will have a chance to explore those topics in more depth later and ask them to re-focus on identifying the organization of the critical processes.

#### 2 Threat Brainstorming: The Pre-Mortum

The Pre-Mortum is an exercise used to simplify the complex mapping tasks that the participants have just taken part in. With the process maps created the participants are to come up with the reasons that these process' could be disrupted and the consequences of those disruptions.

>"[This] Excercise is to ask planner to imagine that it is months into the future and that their plan has been carried out. And it has failed. That is all they know; they have to explain why they think it has failed. they have to look for the causes that would make them say, "Of course, it wasn't going to work, because..." The idea is that they are breaking the emotional attachment to the plan's success by taking on the challenge of showing their creativity and competence by identifying likely sources of breakdown." - Klein

*NOTE:* There are other threat brainstorming activities besides pre-mortum that an auditor can use. We chose the pre-mortum activity as the basic activity taught for SAFETAG because it assumes that the participants have a realistic understanding of the threats that they face. In the future we will include activities for groups who feel un-realisticly safe (Action Movie - Shostack ) or un-realisticly at risk.

Note that the narrative nature of this brainstorm often provides a lot of information that is not relevant to the current activity, but that the facilitator will want for future activities.  This tends to include items such as assets, adversaries, risks, and consequences. There are many ways of capturing this data:

  * The facilitator can assign participants to be responsible for specific topics (assets, threat actors, risks, consequences.)
	* The facilitator can have separate lists on the wall that they write assets and threat actors on so that they can quickly jot them down.

### Risk Modeling: Creating a Risk Assessment Matrix

*Introduction:* 

#### A. Explaining the types of threats

  * If unauthorized individuals find out an asset/process.
    * Confidentiality is keeping assets or knowledge about assets away from unauthorized parties.
  * If an asset/process can be accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    * Control is the regulation of access to assets.
  * If an asset/process is changed without permission.
    * Integrity is keeping assets undamaged and unaltered.
  * If an asset/process becomes unavailable.
    * Availability is the assurance that assets are available to parties authorized to use them.
  * If an asset/process becomes unreliable.
    * Consistency is when assets behave and work as expected, all the time.

##### Talking points for the trainer (basic/advanced)

1. This short exercise is not as interactive for the host organizations participants as many in this section, and as such can be more difficult for a trainee who is less comfortable lecturing to groups.

#### B. Identifying the consequence of threat on identified process/action


In this exercise the trainee leads the participants in an overview of the consequences of the identified during the activity and then a **rapid** ranking of the importance of process' based upon the consequences if they fail. 


This exercise has the trainee lead the participants on a brainstorming of hypothetical consequences when certain threats occur to the process' and actions identified earlier. Identify the warning's, notices, status indicators, training, and policies that already exist to address these risks.

##### Talking points for the trainer (basic/advanced)

1. Current approaches to addressing these risks are used to anchor the recommendations in the final report within existing organizational practices.
  * This helps to remove the barrier of starting from zero for activities that the organization has already implemented technical or non-technical approaches for.
  * (Shostack: Threat Modeling pg. 298)

2. It can be easy for a group to get distracted arguing over the likelihood of certain risks over others.

#### C. Ranking the severity of consequences

The goal of this exercise is to have the trainee lead the participants in classifying the severity of the possible consequences from the risks they have just explored. On one side of the scale are "Inconvenient" consequences that disrupt the organization in a very small way. On the other side are "critical" consequences that may pose life-safety risks to employee's, partners, or the general public.

##### Interaction with the Participants:
##### Talking points for the trainer (basic/advanced)

1. As consequences are placed on the wall, the trainee can use other already ranked consequences to help participants identify the right place.
  * "Is another news organization publishing a story before us more or less severe than losing a long-term insider source?"

2. Take photos of the severity scale to record it for later.

#### D. Estimating Likelyhood of Risks

The goal of this exercise is to have the trainee lead the host organization in estimating the likelyhood of the risk occurring. The auditor has the participants prioritize the risks on a scale of their likelyhood.  On one side "certain" attacks that the participants know will happen. On the other side "limited" events that the participants believe are less likely to occur than to not occur.
