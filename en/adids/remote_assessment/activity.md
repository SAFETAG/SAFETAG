### Activity

If the energy level is a bit low, consider using the "Two Truths and a Lie" energizer from [Level Up](https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/icebreakers-energizers#Icebreakers) to start this lesson:

Instructions:

* Two options: Have participants pair up with someone they don't know OR Have everyone face each other in a circle.
* Ask participants to say two true things about themselves and one lie.
* Give them a few minutes to think about it.
* Once they are ready, everyone takes turns saying two true things and one lie about themselves.
* Those who are not speaking must guess which are the truths and which one is the lie.

Notes:

* The group version of this works best with a smaller number of participants (10 participants maximum).
* This may have some language issues. If you have a mixed group of participants who are not versed in one language, this may be difficult to pull off; you could have them pair up with a fellow participant who speaks the same language, but you don't want them to pair up with someone they already know.
* This works for when you have participants who have problems with mobility as this won't require them to move.
