* Any physical notes taken on physical security should be destroyed. Digital notes should be kept in line with overall SAFETAG standards.
* The location of certain high-value assets is highly sensitive, and may be controlled/secret information. Handle with care when discussing with the organization, and if conducting this remotely/in advance, ensure the point of contact can handle and destroy the data responsibly.
* If using drawing software, note that using free online tools could easily leave sensitive data exposed. Offline tools such as LibreOffice Draw, Pencil (http://pencil.evolus.vn/Downloads.html), or even Microsoft Powerpoint or Visio all work.
* Any photos taken (of the map drawing or specific office areas/rooms) should be securely deleted or taken using a secure camera app such as [ObscuraCam](https://guardianproject.info/apps/obscuracam/)
* It should be noted that SAFETAG is focused only on the digital impacts of physical security.  This guide does not provide a full physical security assessment.
