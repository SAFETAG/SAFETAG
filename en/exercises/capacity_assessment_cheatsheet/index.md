#### Capacity Assessment Checklist

##### Summary

A monolithic, one-time interview with key staff is not always possible or advisable, but interacting with a variety of staff exposes valuable information about every aspect of the audit, from vulnerabilities to capacity to hidden barriers.  This serves as a "cheat sheet" of some topics to explore both during the planning and preparation phase and throughout the audit process.
