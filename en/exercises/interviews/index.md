#### Interviews

##### Summary
The auditor conducts interviews with various staff members to gather information on the organizations risks and capacity.

Q&A sessions are unabashedly _white box_ aspects of a security assessment, and you will occasionally hear push-back along the lines of, "You wouldn't have found that thing if we hadn't told you about this other thing." Compelling _black box_ findings certainly do have an advantage when it comes to persuasiveness, but obtaining them can be quite time-consuming, so relying exclusively on vulnerabilities that you can identify without "help" is generally a mistake in this resource-constrained sector.

##### Overview

  * Set up secure channels for communication
  * Interview managerial staff
  * Interview technical staff
  * Use the Categories (at the end of the sample interview questions) to help scope which questions to ask
  * Use the Capacity Assessment Cheat-Sheet to track topics you have covered
  * Provide (and track) a time limit for each interview

##### Materials Needed

##### Considerations

  * If the auditor or organization believes that there is a good chance of surveillance on the channel you are communicating over, do the rest of the interview on a secured channel or in person where possible, though some information-gathering is critical to do before planning the audit. Inability to do so contributes towards a no-go situation.

##### Walkthrough
The questions below are roughly divided into categories for management, program staff, and technical staff.  The questions for technical staff may be best asked of the manager or another point of contact.  Within that section, there are specific questions that often only actual IT staff are likely to be able to answer.  An auditor may find value in re-asking the same questions to multiple staff members.  Specifically, however, the "Baseline Threat Identification Questions" should be asked of whoever the auditor feels most able or willing to answer them.

In all cases, the HCD Toolkit recommends that you "warm up the participant with questions they are comfortable with." [^HCD_toolkit] -- balance this against not asking questions which you should already know from basic organizational research, followed with informative questions which "prompt bigger, even aspirational, thinking that they may not be accustomed to on a daily basis." [^HCD_toolkit]
