**Introduction**

According to Burp's official [documentation](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1783101-how-to-use-burp-suite), Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. It is **not a point-and-click** tool, but is designed to be used by hands-on testers to support the testing process. With a little bit of effort, anyone can start using the core features of Burp to test the security of their applications. Some of Burp's more advanced features will take further learning and experience to master. All of this investment is hugely worth it - Burp's user-driven workflow is by the far the most effective way to perform web security testing, and will take you way beyond the capabilities of any conventional point-and-click scanner. Burp is intuitive and user-friendly, and the best way to start learning is by doing. These steps will get you started with running Burp and using its basic features. You can then read on deeper into the documentation to become more proficient in using this supremely powerful tool. 

**Getting Started** 
**NOTE from the official documentation:** *Using Burp Suite may result in unexpected effects in some applications. Until you are fully familiar with its functionality and settings, you should only use Burp Suite against non-production systems.*

**Downloading Burpsuite**
Burpsuite is available in free version, which contains the essential tools, and the professional version which includes all of it's features from web vulnerability scanner, advanced manual tools and essential tools.

**Launching Burp**

Burp Suite is a Java application and is distributed as a standalone Java executable file, with the .JAR extension. The Burp JAR file can be executed using a Java Runtime Environment, and there is no need to unpack the contents of the JAR file itself.

To launch Burp, first check whether Java is installed:

Open a command prompt:

 - On Windows, click the Start button, type ```cmd``` into the search box, and click on the ```cmd.exe``` item under "Programs".
 - On Mac OS X, in the system dock, click on Applications, then Utilities, then Terminal.app.
 - On Linux, look in your lists of applications for an item called ```console``` or ```shell```.

In the command prompt window, type: 
```
java -version
```
If Java is installed, you will see a message like: ```java version "1.6.0_21"```. To run Burp, you will need a version of Java that is 1.6 or later. 

If Java is not installed, or if your version of Java is older than 1.6, you will need to install Java. [Download the latest Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), run the installer, and then open a new command prompt and start again. 

 With Java installed, on some platforms you may be able to run Burp directly by double-clicking the Burp JAR file. However, it is preferable to launch Burp from the command line, as this gives you more control over its execution, in particular the amount of memory that your computer assigns to Burp. To do this, in your command prompt type a command like:
```
java -jar -Xmx1024m /path/to/burp.jar
```
where 1024 is the amount of memory (in Mb) that you want to assign to Burp, and /path/to/burp.jar is the location of the Burp JAR file on your computer.

If everything is working, a splash screen should display for a few seconds, and then the main startup wizard window should appear. If nothing happens, or if an error message appears, please refer to the [troubleshooting help](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_troubleshooting.html).
