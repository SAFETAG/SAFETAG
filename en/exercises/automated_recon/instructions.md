Both Recon-ng and Foca are open source reconnaissance tools with many available plugins. Foca is, out-of-the-box, more aimed at extracting metadata from documents and images, whereas Recon is slightly more focused on finding digging into domains, subdomains, contacts, and the more network-level information.  Both tools are best used in addition to critical thinking and manual exploration, and require "seed" inputs to get started and careful curation to remove false leads.
