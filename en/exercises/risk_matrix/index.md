#### Creating a Risk Matrix

##### Summary

As part of SAFETAG's dedication to building agency and supporting organizational adoption of safer practices, a careful prioritization of vulnerabilities is invaluable in keeping audit results from appearing overwhelming. In addition, this component ranks the vulnerabilties identified using the risk-matrix developed with the host organization's staff. Using the host-created framework will allow for a deeper understanding of the impact of vulnerabilities and encourage greater investment in addressing them.

##### Overview
Vulnerability prioritization is a critical process. It is vital that the reasoning an auditor uses during this stage are documented and available within the report. If an auditor does not create accurate associations between the host identified impact or uses an inaccurate assessment of adversary capabilities it can lessen the credibility of the recommendations made.

After the activities are complete the auditor has tasks that build upon the outputs of the activities.

* Chart vulnerabilities against likelihood
* A short overview of the how the likelihood was determined for each vulnerability.
* A listing of the process, impact, and likelihood for each vulnerability.
* Create a risk matrix placing *impacts* against a range of likelihood.
* An overview of the risks the organization is accepting until they address each vulnerability.

##### Materials Needed

* Stickies
* Markers
* Whiteboard or flip-chart

##### Considerations

  * Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.
  * Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization’s country, or is known to surveil.

##### Walkthrough

**Identify and rank vulnerabilities**

* Identify the possible impact of the vulnerability.
* Identify any threats to critical process' the vulnerability makes possible.
* Identify the process with the greatest impact if interrupted.
* Identify the possibility of exploitation.
* Identify the level of resources required to exploit the vulnerability.
* Compare the resources required against the capabilities identified in the risk modeling activities and the contextual research you completed.




**Build a vulnerability/likelihood matrix**

* Position the vulnerability on the risk matrix in relation to its likelihood and its impact.

**Create a risk matrix**

* Place *impacts* against a range of likelihood.
* Clean up critical process maps for use in reporting.
* Create a list of all services or assets that were identified during the activity that were not already known by the auditor.
