#### Report Creation

##### Summary
This component consists of an auditor compiling their audit notes and recommendations into a comprehensive set of documents the shows the current state of security, the process by which the auditor came to that assessment, and recommendations that will guide the hosts progression to meet their security goals.

##### Overview

Once an auditor has left, the report is the auditor's chance to continue a conversation (albeit a static one) -- even if the organization never talks to the auditor again. If written with care it can be a tool to encourage agency and guide adoption. The report has many audiences who will need to use it in different ways. For the auditor and the organization, it acts as documentation of what an auditor accomplished.  For the organization, it will be guide for connecting vulnerabilities to actual risks, a rallying cry for change, and proof of need for funders. For those the organization brings in to support their digital security, it provides a roadmap towards that implementation and a task-list for future technologists and trainers paid to get the host there - as well as a checklist for validating that threats have been addressed.

* **Target  Invested Parties:** During the audit identify parties who will impact the vulnerability remediation process (e.g. funders, external contractors, partners) and work with the organization to target components of the report at those parties. Do the recommendation that you have fit into any narratives that you heard from staff?
* **Visualizing Charts:** Create charts and visuals for the roadmap, risk-matrix, implementation matrix, and critical processes.
* **Document Translation:** Compose sections that will be shared with invested parties (funders, technical support, trainers) to support the organizations aims for those parties.

##### Materials Needed

##### Considerations

  * Treat the report with the utmost security. It should only be shared as a complete work between the auditor(s) and the identified leadership and points of contact of the organization.

##### Walkthrough

  * Create charts and visuals for roadmap, risk-matrix, implementation matrix, and critical processes.
  * Compile approaches, impact, risk, recommendations and resources for each vulnerability.
  * Prepare narrative components.
  * Write explanations for why any adversaries or threats that the auditor identifies as "un-addressable" with the organizations current capacity.
  * Collect agreements & scope.
  * Document tools used for testing where needed.
  * Update glossary where needed.
  * Compile full report contents.
  * Send the report to client. [^secure_reporting]
  * Document updates to activities to submit back to SAFETAG.
